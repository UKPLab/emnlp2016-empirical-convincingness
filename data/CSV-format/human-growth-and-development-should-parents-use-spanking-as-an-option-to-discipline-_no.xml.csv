So its better to be a bit strict, than to abuse a kid.	Spanking should never be the answer.

The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.	No, because they don't really understand what they are doing since they are barely growing up and still trying to understand the world.

arg334934_arg335032	o6_2	A parent shouldn't use spanking as an option to discipline a child because they might grow up traumatized and they might feel unloved since they would get spanked a lot, that will cause a low self of esteem. Also spanking shouldn't be an option because at that moment the parent would be full with anger and they wouldn't be thinking logically.	Spanking should never be the answer.

There is other techniques they can learn from.	No because if we hit our children their gonna think that we don't love them.
arg335104_arg335086	o9_3,o6_1	Because spanking is mostly out of anger and can be for more then what your kid had done like if some one else made thm mad thy let it all out on thm	The child is young and doesn't know what is wrong and what is right.

arg335564_arg334926	o8_1	Nope. I believe it shouldnt be done just to discipline a child. Parents could just scold their child just so they would stop what they are doing wrong. Hitting is not really a solution because aside hurting a child emotionally, it also hurts them physically. Kids wouldnt learn the value of respect for their parents because they would only learn how to be scared. They wont do the wrong action again next time, not because they've learned their lesson, but because they are just scared that their parents would hit them	No child should get hit. There are different punishments you could give your child.
arg334918_arg334978	o8_1	Because if the child is young they dont know whats wrong and whats right the parent needs to teach the child from whats wrong and from whats right	I don't think that spanking should be necessary,spanking would last just a minute, but punishing could last up to 2 or 3 weeks or maybe more.
arg334978_arg336894	o8_1,o6_1	It is unnecessary, as well as being quite unrelated to how a child develops into an adult.

arg335084_arg334961	o9_1	I think parents should not spank because there's other way to make them behave.	I say no because spanking doesn't really solve the problem, anyone can get over a spanking fast, and do whatever they did again. So its better to be a bit strict, than to abuse a kid.

arg334934_arg334891	o8_1,o7_1	A parent shouldn't use spanking as an option to discipline a child because they might grow up traumatized and they might feel unloved since they would get spanked a lot, that will cause a low self of esteem. Also spanking shouldn't be an option because at that moment the parent would be full with anger and they wouldn't be thinking logically.

arg334978_arg336204	o8_1	I strongly believe parents should not use physical punishment like spanking to discipline their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it.

arg334926_arg334907	o8_1	Spanking children will bad for their development. We always teach children not to hurt others, but we do it on our children . It is not make sense.	No child should get hit. There are different punishments you could give your child.
arg334943_arg335091	o8_4,o9_4	No because spanking might effects the relationship between the child and parents. And Children can pick up on the parents attitude acting violent. There are better ways to solve problems, for example using the other techniques.	Parents shouldn't use spanking as an option to discipline it just makes the child get mad than to see what they did wrong.
arg335095_arg336204	o8_1,o6_1	I strongly believe parents should not use physical punishment like spanking to discipline their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.	Spanking should not be an option to discipline a child, parents have a lot other options before spanking. Its better to talk to them about what they did wrong and solve the problem in a proper way.

arg336172_arg334934	o8_1,o9_4	A parent shouldn't use spanking as an option to discipline a child because they might grow up traumatized and they might feel unloved since they would get spanked a lot, that will cause a low self of esteem. Also spanking shouldn't be an option because at that moment the parent would be full with anger and they wouldn't be thinking logically.	Not everything begins with violence, parents shouldn't hit kids for discipline, only if its necessary .
arg334891_arg335032	o7_2	Honestly, I believe that spanking shouldn't be accepted to discipline a child. There are many options that parents can take.

arg335129_arg334961	o8_4,o6_1	I say no because spanking doesn't really solve the problem, anyone can get over a spanking fast, and do whatever they did again.

arg336179_arg335096	o8_4	No because hitting your child could mentally scar them for life. also it can make them think hitting their kids is alright.	Parents shouldn't use spanking as an option to discipline it just makes the child get mad than to see what they did wrong.
arg334890_arg335114	o6_1	No, because they don't always need to get spanked for everything they do. Their parents need to teach them different ways.	There's some parents that spank their children for every little thing. And that is not right. They will always be scared of them.

arg336894_arg334960	o8_1	It is unnecessary, as well as being quite unrelated to how a child develops into an adult. There are children who were spanked growing up who grow up to be terrible adults, and children who were not spanked growing up who become good or even great adults.	Parents should not rely on spanking their children when they are misbehaving. Although, it may sometimes seem necessary to spank your children, in my opinion it should always be the last resort.
arg334918_arg336048	o8_1	People should not hit there kids because the kid will think it is OK to hit someone else back like for an example at school they will end up fighting and abusive to others.	Because if the child is young they dont know whats wrong and whats right the parent needs to teach the child from whats wrong and from whats right
arg335086_arg335132	o7_2	I disagree on the parents use spaking as an option to dicipline because the childrens are not going to be scare of what their parents are going to them and also because if you do that to your childrens are learning what their parents show them and also because that is not going to help that much the childrens	The child is young and doesn't know what is wrong and what is right.
