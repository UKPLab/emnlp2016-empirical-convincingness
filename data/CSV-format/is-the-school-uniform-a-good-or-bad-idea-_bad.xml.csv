I take the view that, school uniform is very comfortable. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways.

On another, uniforms also help with keeping order in a school(kids are highly impressionable... etc.....). But kids are allowed ot have thier own creativity. <br/> Just like any other law or code, they can have specific rules to prevent wearing certain things.	I think that school uniform is a bad idea because its too much work to clean the uniform and its a pain if you have to put on a lot of stuff in the mmorning
arg199550_arg554188	o7_4	In comparison to civil dress, school uniforms prove to be futile and wasteful once the child is out of school.	School uniforms are a BAD idea. Kids won't be able to show their color.
arg251309_arg198954	o6_1	The school my mother works at, plus the school district my cousin's 3 children are in, are utilizing school uniforms. One reason is to "reduce bullying", which in reality, doesn't even address the problem concerning bullying. The only good it does is that it gets rid of or reduces students being bullied because they aren't wearing a specific clothing label that they dictate is the IN thing to wear. While it's a problem, all it does is sweep the one basic type of bullying under the rug. Kids will find other reasons to bully others. It also infringes upon their basic rights to be individuals and to express their individuality.	I truly believe that wearing uniform is bad, because it is not helping to student to express his/her individuality. It is also very uncomfortable , and during winter time might very cold as well. That is why schools shouldn't force students to wear uniform.
arg202425_arg336277	o8_5,o7_1	the kids lose their individuality and it doesn't feel comfortable	Kids don't want to wear the same clothes every day I know I would hate it.
arg251644_arg237112	o7_3,o7_4	When yr out of college or High School or whatever, like in a office. You have to choose yr own clothing.	because your own clothes are coolio hoolio, and if you get to wear what you want its coolio hoolio

arg386882_arg238468	o7_4	I have always maintained that it is a good idea to wear a uniform to school. Why not? because it looks very nice and respectful. This shows the status of schools and students. I always liked to wear a uniform at my school, I felt like a schoolgirl, and brought up.	Bad. I'm too lazy to explain why so take my word for it. I had to wear one for 4 years at school.
arg252467_arg386882	o8_1,o6_1	i dont think its a good idea to keep restrictions becoz thats just going to make students especialy teens more hungry for fashion .its better 2 feed them than keeping them hungry.and once they r away from these restrictions,we will c d othr side of them which is way worse with no morals.so alow people 2 b free with their personalities instead of stoping them.	Bad. I'm too lazy to explain why so take my word for it. I had to wear one for 4 years at school.
arg199159_arg198939	o8_1	I want to mention about wearing school uniform by high school students. it really makes no sense, it's the opposite, it just makes troubles within students and teachers relations. People aged 16-18 do not like any limits and sometimes limiting their freedom can become very serious problem followed by misunderstandings with the rest of people like parents and teachers. What about the controlling person's behavior - it must be done in the childhood, but not in the age when students become adults.	The last thing which a school ought to do is attempt to hinder the creative expression - the individuality - of their still-developing children.
arg386882_arg284049	o8_1,o6_1,o6_2	students should wear what they like and feel free about their clothes	Bad. I'm too lazy to explain why so take my word for it. I had to wear one for 4 years at school.
arg200706_arg287477	o5_2	We talk about how schools destroy creativity and uniforms are a classic example of that destruction. In most schools with uniforms the students are given the occasional day to were their casual clothes but are then given strict guidelines as to what is acceptable. This is effectively turning "casual clothes" into a twisted "causal" uniform.	it dose not show kids expressions and unforms dose not show is it
arg236737_arg238468	o8_1	I think it is bad to wear school uniform because it makes you look unatrel and you cannot express yourself enough so band school uniform OK	I have always maintained that it is a good idea to wear a uniform to school.

arg199549_arg233332	o9_4	Another reason argued against school uniforms is that they deprive the children of their individuality. The stress on a uniform dress code in school opposes the spirit of unity in diversity and its celebration. It is even claimed to restrict socialization, a vital aspect of human nature.	Only in private schools and even there I would only agree with it because its a voluntary association. You see I think school uniforms supress free speech, and take away from a youth's individuality.

I take the view that, school uniform is very comfortable. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Every teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.
