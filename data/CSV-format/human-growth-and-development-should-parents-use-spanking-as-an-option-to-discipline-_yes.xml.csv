arg335124_arg334886	o8_1,o8_5,o5_3	Yes, because then they wont do what they did in fear of getting spanked again. Since they will know the consequence. Although, there is also a line a parent shouldn't cross such as the appropriate spanking and abuse line.	Sometimes that's what a kid needs to behave all those Nos, stops, don't do that, just don't work sometimes.
arg335285_arg334893	o8_1,o6_1,o6_2	Yes , because if they are afraid of getting spanked then they won't do it again . The parent should only spank them and not go over board and keep hitting them .	spanking is your decision kids can be bad but use it as a last resort
arg334967_arg335098	o8_1,o8_5,o6_1,o7_1	I support this because... I got spanked and I turned out to be a good daughter ..spanking teaches you not to do it again and be scared of doing it again.	I think spanking should be an option. Although I believe it should be an option, I believe it should be a last option.
arg336199_arg335054	o8_1,o6_1,o6_2,o7_1	I have been spanked once in a while for worse deeds. I think it did more good than harm to be honest. It's like touching fire to be honest, but a lot of it depends on parents and kids. It may do its job it may not, but abuse is never good.	I agree but it has to be used as the last source and not used constantly and of course not to hard.
arg335092_arg336043	o8_4,o8_5,o9_1,o5_2,o6_1	I think spanking should be used if it will teach thee child in the long run but each child responds differently to different punishments while one child just telling them no or grounding them will work on another child it may take a spanking to teach them right and wrong.	I think you should hit you kids because if they did something really bad like crash your car or steal you need to hit them so they know that they should not be doing that.
arg334884_arg336176	o8_1,o6_1	I believe so, it should be used as a last resort at least because I being a sibling of three, was spanked along with my sister and turned out to be disciplined and on the other hand our youngest sister has never been spanked and she tends to make more mistakes even now that shes 10 than we did.	Yes so they can give the kids a reason not to do it again.
arg334921_arg335134	o8_1,o6_2	After I was spanked, I never did the same thing twice.. So therefore I would spank my kids, out of love, and on the butt.	I believe spanking is a good option to punish a child if nothing else works
arg335089_arg334964	o8_1,o7_4	I agree because they must understand they where wrong. For their actions, they will receive consequences, and from that they will learn to not do it again.	yes because if they fear getting hit than they wont do it again

arg335097_arg335285	o8_1,o9_4,o5_2	In my opinion, I strongly agree that parents should use spanking as an option to discipline their children because the spankings are painful enough for children to learn to avoid doing the wrong things.	spanking is your decision kids can be bad but use it as a last resort
arg334921_arg334922	o8_1	After I was spanked, I never did the same thing twice.. So therefore I would spank my kids, out of love, and on the butt.	I say yes because children are getting more and more violent and they need to get discipline if they decide to act up.
arg335047_arg334922	o8_1,o6_1	Parents should use spanking as an option to discipline only when it's needed.

Yes, because 1 getting hit helps you be stronger and grow up and 2 it makes you listen , it's not ABUSE it's getting spanked.
arg334938_arg335285	o8_1,o8_4,o8_5,o6_1	After a spanking I made sure I never did it again to avoid being punished because the second time is always worst because you were told not to already.	spanking is your decision kids can be bad but use it as a last resort

arg335134_arg334884	o7_1	I believe so, it should be used as a last resort at least because I being a sibling of three, was spanked along with my sister and turned out to be disciplined and on the other hand our youngest sister has never been spanked and she tends to make more mistakes even now that shes 10 than we did.	I believe spanking is a good option to punish a child if nothing else works

arg334967_arg335089	o8_5,o6_1	yes because if they fear getting hit than they wont do it again	I think spanking should be an option. Although I believe it should be an option, I believe it should be a last option.
arg334920_arg334898	o6_1	I think parents should use spanking as an option to discipline but there is also a limit for everything so they shouldn't use it every time the kids do something wrong.	It shouldn't be used constantly but it should be used to get the message across to the child
arg336199_arg334884	o8_1	I believe so, it should be used as a last resort at least because I being a sibling of three, was spanked along with my sister and turned out to be disciplined and on the other hand our youngest sister has never been spanked and she tends to make more mistakes even now that shes 10 than we did.	I agree but it has to be used as the last source and not used constantly and of course not to hard.
arg335090_arg335134	o8_1,o9_4	Yes I believe you should spank a child only when they know they are wrong. The child will understand more if he is scared to do the same mistake. Actions speak louder than words.	I believe spanking is a good option to punish a child if nothing else works

Yes, because they need to learn in a way that they remember that if they do something bad. They will get hit.
arg335097_arg335094	o8_1,o9_1,o7_1,o7_4	In my opinion, I strongly agree that parents should use spanking as an option to discipline their children because the spankings are painful enough for children to learn to avoid doing the wrong things.	It's ok for the parent to spank the child as long as it's not often or they don't use other things like a belt.
arg334920_arg334938	o8_5	After a spanking I made sure I never did it again to avoid being punished because the second time is always worst because you were told not to already.	It shouldn't be used constantly but it should be used to get the message across to the child
arg336043_arg334922	o8_1	I think spanking should be used if it will teach thee child in the long run but each child responds differently to different punishments while one child just telling them no or grounding them will work on another child it may take a spanking to teach them right and wrong.	I say yes because children are getting more and more violent and they need to get discipline if they decide to act up.

Yes, parents should use spanking as an option to discipline their children, but it should be the last option.
arg334921_arg336222	o8_1,o9_3,o7_1	Humans have been raised for thousands of years with not near as much resentment towards spanking and today's kids are the unruliest there are... <br/> There's a trend... <br/> (I do admit it's not purely spanking that's the cause but it's a small part of the bigger picture)	After I was spanked, I never did the same thing twice.. So therefore I would spank my kids, out of love, and on the butt.
arg334923_arg335134	o8_1,o8_4	I think that children should get spanked once in a while. I got spanked when I was little but I could definitely say that I did learn lessons.

arg334922_arg335054	o6_1	I have been spanked once in a while for worse deeds. I think it did more good than harm to be honest.

I think you should hit you kids because if they did something really bad like crash your car or steal you need to hit them so they know that they should not be doing that.
arg335047_arg334920	o8_1,o6_1	Parents should use spanking as an option to discipline only when it's needed.

arg334964_arg336043	o8_4,o9_2	I think spanking should be used if it will teach thee child in the long run but each child responds differently to different punishments while one child just telling them no or grounding them will work on another child it may take a spanking to teach them right and wrong.	I agree because they must understand they where wrong. For their actions, they will receive consequences, and from that they will learn to not do it again.

I say yes because children are getting more and more violent and they need to get discipline if they decide to act up.
arg336043_arg336171	o8_1	I think spanking should be used if it will teach thee child in the long run but each child responds differently to different punishments while one child just telling them no or grounding them will work on another child it may take a spanking to teach them right and wrong.	I believe that spanking you child because it shows then that what they did was wrong and if they dont want the feeling of a but woppen then they wont make the same mistake twice.
arg334932_arg335054	o8_5,o6_1	I have been spanked once in a while for worse deeds. I think it did more good than harm to be honest. It's like touching fire to be honest, but a lot of it depends on parents and kids. It may do its job it may not, but abuse is never good.	Yes, because 1 getting hit helps you be stronger and grow up and 2 it makes you listen , it's not ABUSE it's getting spanked.
arg334959_arg334922	o8_4	yea, because even though there are many other different ways to discipline kids, sometimes it won't work so they need a little spank, just to make them learn they were wrong. don't always be spanking them for no reason, that's bad	I say yes because children are getting more and more violent and they need to get discipline if they decide to act up.

It's like touching fire to be honest, but a lot of it depends on parents and kids. It may do its job it may not, but abuse is never good.	spanking can be sometimes good for the child to understand but not to the point where you can hurt and should not be used repeatedly
arg336171_arg334923	o8_5,o7_1	I think that children should get spanked once in a while. I got spanked when I was little but I could definitely say that I did learn lessons. Don't spank your kids though with whatever you find, you don't want to kill them !!	I believe that spanking you child because it shows then that what they did was wrong and if they dont want the feeling of a but woppen then they wont make the same mistake twice.
arg336171_arg334938	o8_5,o7_1	After a spanking I made sure I never did it again to avoid being punished because the second time is always worst because you were told not to already.	I believe that spanking you child because it shows then that what they did was wrong and if they dont want the feeling of a but woppen then they wont make the same mistake twice.

Don't spank your kids though with whatever you find, you don't want to kill them !!	because depending on the punishment you give a child it doesn't always work, some kids need need that. because just sitting them in punishment its a possibility they will do it again.
arg336171_arg334932	o5_2,o7_4	Yes, because 1 getting hit helps you be stronger and grow up and 2 it makes you listen , it's not ABUSE it's getting spanked.	I believe that spanking you child because it shows then that what they did was wrong and if they dont want the feeling of a but woppen then they wont make the same mistake twice.
arg335094_arg335089	o6_1	It's ok for the parent to spank the child as long as it's not often or they don't use other things like a belt.	yes because if they fear getting hit than they wont do it again
arg334921_arg335047	o8_1,o6_1	Parents should use spanking as an option to discipline only when it's needed. If the child doesn't follow the correct behavior that they should follow after several times being warned, then that is when the child deserves a spanking.	After I was spanked, I never did the same thing twice.. So therefore I would spank my kids, out of love, and on the butt.
arg334920_arg335092	o5_2	It shouldn't be used constantly but it should be used to get the message across to the child	I think you should hit you kids because if they did something really bad like crash your car or steal you need to hit them so they know that they should not be doing that.
arg335098_arg335054	o9_2	I support this because... I got spanked and I turned out to be a good daughter ..spanking teaches you not to do it again and be scared of doing it again.	I have been spanked once in a while for worse deeds. I think it did more good than harm to be honest. It's like touching fire to be honest, but a lot of it depends on parents and kids. It may do its job it may not, but abuse is never good.
arg335097_arg334972	o8_5	In my opinion, I strongly agree that parents should use spanking as an option to discipline their children because the spankings are painful enough for children to learn to avoid doing the wrong things.	I believe some parents should spank their kids but only when nessasary because sometimes thats the only way some kids will learn the correct way and listen.

arg334898_arg335090	o9_1	Yes I believe you should spank a child only when they know they are wrong. The child will understand more if he is scared to do the same mistake. Actions speak louder than words.	I think parents should use spanking as an option to discipline but there is also a limit for everything so they shouldn't use it every time the kids do something wrong.
arg335034_arg334967	o8_1	Yes, because they need to learn in a way that they remember that if they do something bad. They will get hit.	I think spanking should be an option. Although I believe it should be an option, I believe it should be a last option.
