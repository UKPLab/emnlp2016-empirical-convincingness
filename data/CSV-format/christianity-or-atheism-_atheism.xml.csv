Science has proven it. It was just an excuse made up so people from simplier times didnt have to think to hard on those big questions.
arg244514_arg229484	o8_5,o5_1	Even if there was a valid proof for the existence of god, there would be no valid proof that that god is Christian or not.	It is ignorant and idiotic to think that god exist. Any other argument is completely invalid.

arg231487_arg240625	o8_5	this is my big problem with christianity: why is it about belief. there have been horrible people who are believers. what about wonderful people who do great things for the world and are atheists. is it fair to punish them for not knowing what the nature od reality is??? I AM an atheist and im a good person. the idea that a mere belief difference can seal ones fate is beyond preposterous, its madness!!	christians are also fun to lawl at because they waste half of their sunday going to church. What a waste!!!! HAHAHA
arg270902_arg613494	o8_1	Religion in the past has caused many wars. It encourages racism , sexism and homophobia. It is something that gives us prejudice. It makes us hate one another. the time has come to put a stop to it.	No one has ever waged a war in the name of atheism.
arg328210_arg229398	o9_3	Notmymuse, <br/> Give me one logical reason to believe Christianity. Just one. <br/> I have yet to see one gad damn shred of evidence for Christianity. I have also seen mountains of evidence to the contrary. <br/> Once you have discredited ALL evidence against Christianity, create an argument for Christianity with empirical fact (or a damn solid priori argument). <br/> Once you have done this, disprove ALL logical arguments against Christianity. <br/> Once you have done this, disprove all other religions. <br/> - <br/> Until such a time that you have done ALL of these things, it is illogical to believe in this bible bullshit.	I'm Christian and very religious, but if the description of this argument is the qualifying factor, I'm going with Atheism. God isn't Christian.

I choose atheism over a Christianity because their is not enough evidence to soothe my curiosity. Christianity raises too many questions that it never answers.
arg231494_arg246334	o8_4,o5_2,o6_1	As humans, we cannot know exactly if there is a higher force or not. Christianity however is not it. Firstly because it is not one belief that every Christian shares, it lacks solidarity. I compare it to a road with all different kinds of sideways. Ask a question about religion, and lots of people will find one of those sideways to adjust their religion to their personal beliefs. <br/> With Athe√Øsm, the concept is pretty clear. It is more scientific, and I like that.	we have scientific evidence that the flood of noah could not have happened.

arg229388_arg254062	o5_1	The greatest reason to find any given deity unreasonable is that you can replace it with one who has lied to humanity about literally everything it says, and we wouldn't be the wiser. <br/> What makes it even weaker is that you can also replace it with a series of lies of humans or hallucinations. <br/> There is no a single prophecy in the Bible, and certainly none that have come true.
