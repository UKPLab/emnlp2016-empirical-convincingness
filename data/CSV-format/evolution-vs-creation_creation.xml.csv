When you look at a computer do you question that there had to be a creator? Or do you need proof that this highly organized machine came to be about by a mere accident or order of circumstances? Evolutionists need more faith than Creationists.	That's your best argument - "Because they don't" ? <br/> I thought there was a reason for everything... <br/> I don't see the squirrel outside my window evolving. In fact, I'm pretty sure squirrels have looked and acted the same for thousands of years. <br/> How does an animal aquire a trait that he wasn't born with? Does he just wish for it really hard and it magically grows? <br/> And you proved my point - "species have certain characteristics and properties" <br/> I noticed you didn't mention that their characteristics randomly change <br/> And by the way, I'm just wondering because I'm a curious person... <br/> what insects are you talking about?
12579_12568	o8_1	God is abstract. He doesn't often show himself. In general, the idea of a god or gods is pretty hard to think about. <br/> Apes are concrete. You can see them. Generally, the whole ape concept is easy to get your hands around. <br/> It's funny that the supposedly unsophisticated ancients would all choose to believe in an abstract concept rather than a concrete one. If you asked Adam where he came from, why would he say "God must have created me, I've seen Him around the garden" instead of "I was magically transformed from one of those apes over there"?	Actually, creationism is an argument that has been in existence since the beginning of recorded history <br/> With the writing of the Old Testament <br/> I think you are referring to a time of more recent Christianity <br/> So the Biblical account is an argument which has been in existance much longer than your note

Could a unproven higher power have created a perfect world that appeared to have existed for more than 10 million years when really it is only 1 hundred thousand years old?
67586_68938	o5_3	although i voted for evolution... creation is easier to accept due to the fact that someone somewhere had to change aspects of the universe in order for us to exist.

12563_12573	o8_1	* <br/> If evolution is true.... <br/> How come people aren't still evolving?	Oops, I meant to say creationist version of evolution. My apologies.

57300_12588	o8_1,o9_3	That's interesting because the burden of proof rests on you to prove that we are still evolving. <br/> I don't know about anyone else but I haven't noticed mankind change form for a few thousand years.... <br/> Another question- With this whole "big bang" theory. It seems like everything should have blown apart in a big bang and not come together.	now tell me this evolution beleivers... how is it that evolution is true, and man kind is currently not evolving? and how is it (for those of you whom HAVE religion), that adam and eve were the first of the human race to walk on this very planet, the 'parents' of mankind? in arabic makind is 'bani adam' which literally means the tribe of adam...
68913_12577	o7_3	In the 21'st century, we have come to a point where the only way for us to evolve is to start to create. Creation is evolution just with more responsibility placed on mankind.	Why do you assume that god needs to operate within the constraints of time when accusing him of wasting his time? :)
67586_12585	o6_3,o7_2	although i voted for evolution... creation is easier to accept due to the fact that someone somewhere had to change aspects of the universe in order for us to exist.	Ah yes, the classic peppered moth argument <br/> I'm very familiar with it <br/> I'm not sure how that proves the evolutionary process <br/> Both moth colors have always been there <br/> Its just a matter of which is it easier for their prey to see. That's not evolution- <br/> That's a diet plan

Then according to your theory the fruit flies would have adapted and survived <br/> So I'm not really sure how that argument works...

There has to have been a creator. If you believe in 'The Big Bang', then that's fine. But what caused it? And if it was caused by certain gases reacting with each other, then where did those gases come from? It doesn't matter how you think this universe came to be. The point is that it can't have just appeared. There must have been a creator.

12581_68938	o8_1,o7_1	Could a unproven higher power have created a perfect world that appeared to have existed for more than 10 million years when really it is only 1 hundred thousand years old?	Just because you think your opponent has been brainwashed one way or the other does not make your argument any stronger
12581_12592	o8_1,o5_1	I can prove to you that humans have not evolved since the beginning of recorded history	Just because you think your opponent has been brainwashed one way or the other does not make your argument any stronger
12595_12585	o9_3	Believing "Evolution" as in Darwinism and the like, is like believing the puzzle can be solved by pouring the pieces out because two pieces kind of stuck together.

12589_12588	o9_3	That doesn't make much sense. Why are we still evolving and the monkeys aren't? <br/> Why aren't fish jumping out of the water and growing legs? <br/> I mean, if it happened billions of years ago than how come its not happening today? <br/> Why can't we find psuedo-hybrid fish with legs forming? <br/> What caused evolution to stop happening for a mysterious time of thousands of years?	That's interesting because the burden of proof rests on you to prove that we are still evolving. <br/> I don't know about anyone else but I haven't noticed mankind change form for a few thousand years.... <br/> Another question- With this whole "big bang" theory.
