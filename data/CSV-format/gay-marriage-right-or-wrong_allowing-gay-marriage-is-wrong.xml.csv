12433_12469	o7_1	"This idea is essentially playing with semantics." <br/> I did not propose that there be a separate but identical marriage for homosexual relationships and that it be called "civil unions." <br/> "Furthermore, the effects on society are bound to be minimal..." <br/> This is the type of reasoning that the slippery slope argument applies perfectly to. Why not let any small group demand a change with little relative impact? <br/> "...why challenge any assumption?" <br/> I'm not arguing that law shouldn't change. I'm arguing that law developed under one set of assumptions should be blindly applied to a different scenario. Read my rebuttal to res0ndf7 for more on this line.	Gay marriage should be between a man and a woman.
42624_69699	o8_1	An action is ethical if society as a whole would benefit if we all did it. Fair enough? <br/> If everyone had a gay marriage, then society as a whole would NOT benefit. In fact, we would all become extinct, because without one man and one woman there would be no reproduction and continuation of our species. <br/> Therefore, gay marriage can't be ethical. <br/> You can't refute my statement by saying, "There will always be straight people" because that's like saying killing someone is right because there will always be those who won't kill.	its just unnatural because all sexual creatures mate with the opposite sex.
12466_31527	o8_1,o6_3	The Marriage issue should be out of politicians and lawmakers. Marriages are for the Church to decide, Congress have no power to pass a legislation forcing religious institutions about marriage. Maybe, if the courts were to allow gay marriage, it would be alright since it is not a religious institution, it doesn't break the Separation between Church and State ruled by the Supreme Court.	gays are overrated. it is another "look at me" stunt. i think gays are the product of overly protective parents, abuse, or liberal wakoness (it should be a disease). <br/> if you gays would stop calling attention to yourselves, nobody would really care what you do.
12417_12414	o8_1	I vote "Wrong". It goes against human nature and, as other fellow voters have mentioned, the definition of "Marriage". <br/> And you can't exclude religion from this argument, because thats what happened when people don't have faith or belief in any religion. Religion is there to act as guidelines to what is right and what is wrong. Religion is a way of life. Without it, we're lost.	Gay people are making a terrible mistake. I think they are living the life right now with not having to commit to anything. If it was like that for normal marriage life would be a whole lot better.

Oh wait, the sex is the difference, so SISTER and SISTER or BROTHER and BROTHER is ok... right?	Of course its wrong. <br/> Why do you think Aids exists?
80501_12417	o6_1	To me gay marriage is wrong. I respect other opinions but to me it is an unnatural way and against my moral law.	Gay people are making a terrible mistake. I think they are living the life right now with not having to commit to anything. If it was like that for normal marriage life would be a whole lot better.
12413_12441	o7_4	Is incestual marriage right or wrong? Does gay marriage include incestual homosexual marriage? <br/> Which country legalized homosexual unions which lead to a lower marriage rate?	Why are you arguing about a U.S. decision when you are in Canada?
12433_69699	o6_1	"This idea is essentially playing with semantics." <br/> I did not propose that there be a separate but identical marriage for homosexual relationships and that it be called "civil unions." <br/> "Furthermore, the effects on society are bound to be minimal..." <br/> This is the type of reasoning that the slippery slope argument applies perfectly to. Why not let any small group demand a change with little relative impact? <br/> "...why challenge any assumption?" <br/> I'm not arguing that law shouldn't change. I'm arguing that law developed under one set of assumptions should be blindly applied to a different scenario. Read my rebuttal to res0ndf7 for more on this line.	its just unnatural because all sexual creatures mate with the opposite sex.

Opposites Attract, Every where, wether its in magnets, electricity, atoms, or humans. Besides, it just doesnt work with two guys (genitals), thats why there are female reproductive systems and male reproductive systems. They only work together, so there is only one way to reproduce.. Guy AND Girl!	there is no such thing as "gay marriage". Marriage can only be between a man and a woman.
1890830085_73436	o8_1	Marriage is between a man and a woman. It has always been so. If two people want to live in Sin together, I have no problem with that. However, they shouldn't be rewarded with tax breaks. And I sure don't want them to have a platform to spew their garbage and cram it down my kids' throat. Since Homosexuality is a learned sin (think about it) I don't want my kids to learn that it is ok. This public exposure/support of the homosexuals isn't good for morality, and if morality goes, then so does society. (Lord of the Flies)	Gay marriage is wrong. God made man and a woman to populate the earth. How can human species survive if they are only attracted to their same sex? Obviously, not.
30502_31527	o8_4	The Marriage issue should be out of politicians and lawmakers. Marriages are for the Church to decide, Congress have no power to pass a legislation forcing religious institutions about marriage. Maybe, if the courts were to allow gay marriage, it would be alright since it is not a religious institution, it doesn't break the Separation between Church and State ruled by the Supreme Court.	I'm an avid christian and I believe that gay marriage is wrong beyond belief. This country was founded on christian beliefs, and we should adhere to the belifs used to make us what we are today.

12441_12430	o7_1	If being homosexual was natural then <br/> 1. There would only be possibly 6 people on the earth...meaning none of the people making up these sarcastic remakes would be around....heck I wouldn't be around <br/> 2. If homosexuality was natural then the butthole would be in the front part of the body. <br/> Its never been accepted as "natural" by society only till now. So i'm pretty sure thousands of years of recorded human history have a little more weight than some piss ant liberal venting on how its unfair.	Is incestual marriage right or wrong?
