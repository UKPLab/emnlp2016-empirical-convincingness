arg33373_arg33306	o8_5,o5_3,o7_2	No I would not because i would have taken a vow say to stick by them in sickness and health. They might be sick in the head but she would be my wife. If anything id be trying to find a way to keep her from getting caught.	I really dont have an exact yes or no answer to this question depending on the situation. If It really got all out of hand and the police new it was my man that did it and they got all the evidence and witnesses that prove it was him that convicted the crime then yes I would turn him in. If they know its him then its just a matter of time.
arg33225_arg33259	o9_2,o5_2	I dont think i could turn my spouse in, or my family and friends if they committed a murder because those people are way to close to me and i couldnt picture my life without any of them. Why would anyone send away someone they love, i think that is wong especialy if you live with the person.	All I want to say to the spouses of the people on this side of the debate, "Don't confide in your spouse and tell them that you killed somebody; they'll turn you in! And if they find out on their own, take them out before they turn you in!" ;)
arg33358_arg33226	o8_1	I wouldnt turn her in becuase she is my wife. She made a mistake that we can get over it. If she trusted me by telling me what she did then I couldn't do that to her.	No way, <br/> That's even better than a prenup :) <br/> her: "I'm leaving you and taking half your shit." <br/> me: "Hope you like prison b*^#h"
arg33233_arg33242	o7_4	If my wife confided in me than I wouldn't betray her trust. She trusted me to support and help her and I would. I would be extremely angry and maybe even divorce her depending on what type of murder whether it be like a self defence murder or she just thought it would be fun.	More than likely I would not turn in my spouse, because there is that love that binds us together. But on the flip side, if it was just down right cold blooded murder, yes I would turn them in.
arg33300_arg33285	o8_4	If my husband where to commit a murder I would most likely not turn him in. He's my husband and I'm going to be there for him for better or for worst. Yes he made a big mistake and he should pay for it I know that but i don't think I'll have the heart to turn in the man I love. We have to protect each other and be their for each other no matter how bad it is. Even if it makes me his accomplice.	No I wouldn't turn in my spouse. Just because the girl that i married killed someone doesn't make them a terrible person. People make mistakes.
arg33288_arg33259	o8_1	As human beings, we are selfish and have been fabricated with a survival mechanism that tell is to do whatever whenever to protect the ones that we love. I would do everything in my power to protect my love, even if that means taking this horrible secret to the grave.

And if they find out on their own, take them out before they turn you in!" ;)
arg33328_arg33341	o8_1,o7_1,o7_2	If my spouse committed murder I would not turn him in. I would do the exact opposite I will help him hide all evidence if any, I will move if we had to, and I will never bring it up to his attention again. If my husband killed someone, he knew what he was doing, so there or it was for a cost. It would be hard for me to turn in the one I love.	Well it all pretty much depends....Like if she killed someone that deserved it well it would still be scary to sleep with them so this a maybe / maybe not situation... So yeah im not to sure
arg33262_arg33320	o8_1,o6_1	Of course not! Absolutely not! Its something that happened, a mistake she made, and something she would definitely learn from. She was strong enough to tell me about it, something not a lot of people of would done. I'm pretty sure that's not easy for someone to do. Anyone else would of just kept to themselves and not tell anyone. If that were to ever happen, which I strongly doubt, I would definitely support her and be with her, no matter what!	I dont believe i would turn them in because of love.But i certainly would not stay with her; i would move away from her as far as i could.For the simple reason i wouldnt want to be involed with the crime, because i knew about it.
arg33242_arg33341	o8_1,o7_2,o7_4	If my spouse committed murder I would not turn him in. I would do the exact opposite I will help him hide all evidence if any, I will move if we had to, and I will never bring it up to his attention again.

arg33283_arg33319	o9_2	I wouldn't turn my wife in because I love her and married her for a reason. I would trust my wife that she killed someone for a good reason, relatively because murder is still murder. Gene hackman killed the guy her wife was cheating with.	I really don't know because i think it depends on who she murdered and how it happened. If it was self defense then no I wouldn't tell the police, but if she just went crazy and murdered someone then yes i would tell the police.
arg33270_arg33346	o8_1	No. I would not turn my spouse in. I would try to convince him to do the right thing and turn his own self in. But i dont see it as my place to go and turn him in. but it also depends on the reason behind him killing someone. it just cant be some random killing because i would turn him in for that for the fact that i would think that i would be next to get killed.	No. I couldn't imagine turning on my spouse like that. I know if i were to do something like that she will be right there next to me not saying a word. Plus if she were to kill someone it would be for a good reason.
arg33259_arg33343	o8_1,o7_1	I would turn him in because he murdered someone. Don't get me worng I would try to persuade him first to turn himself in but if that didn't happen I would have to take reponsiblity for him. Plus I wouldn't want to feel the guilt of always knowing that I didn't turn that murder in. If he truly loved me I wouldn't have killed someone.	All I want to say to the spouses of the people on this side of the debate, "Don't confide in your spouse and tell them that you killed somebody; they'll turn you in! And if they find out on their own, take them out before they turn you in!" ;)

I would do everything in my power to protect my love, even if that means taking this horrible secret to the grave.	No. I wouldn't be able to turn them in. If you truly love someone you would do anything to help them. Especially if it was an accident. <br/> Though, if he killed some one just because he felt like killing somone it may be a little different, because I wouldnt want him to go nuts and kill me too.
arg33225_arg33353	o8_1,o6_2	I dont think i could turn my spouse in, or my family and friends if they committed a murder because those people are way to close to me and i couldnt picture my life without any of them. Why would anyone send away someone they love, i think that is wong especialy if you live with the person.	No, I wouldn't turn my spouse in I would just be like. You told me I had know part in it. And we are just going to go our separate ways. But truthfully I wouldn't want to know in the first place.
arg33252_arg33354	o8_4,o6_1,o6_3	No I would not turn in my spouse because when you get married you promise to be there for eachother through good or through worse and I would anything to help her but, don't get me wrong though if my spouse were to get caught I will not go down with her because most likley I would have a family to take care of and would not leave them for anything.	If I do that, then who's going to cook and clean house? Who's gonna have sex with me? I'm too old to do the dating scene all over again. Besides, you don't specify who she killed or why. Maybe she had her reasons. Not everyone deserves to live, you know? ;)
arg33306_arg33328	o7_3,o7_4	No I would not because i would have taken a vow say to stick by them in sickness and health. They might be sick in the head but she would be my wife.

arg33242_arg33257	o8_1	Well I definitely would stick by my vows of marriage through the good times and the bad but I mean some people get married without truly knowing who the person is. Hmmm that is a hard one. Well if I truly loved this person I would not turn them in because, I mean I made a promise to them that they could turn to me for help in thick and thin till death do us part.

arg33237_arg33259	o8_1	If my wife was to commit murder and told me about it. I wouldnt turn her in because if you really love her then you would have her back through anything good or bad.	All I want to say to the spouses of the people on this side of the debate, "Don't confide in your spouse and tell them that you killed somebody; they'll turn you in! And if they find out on their own, take them out before they turn you in!" ;)
arg33243_arg33279	o9_2	No I wouldn't tell on him because you never know what the reason might be for him to kill that person or it could have been for self defense for all we know and if the people come question me about anything I DON'T KNOW NOTHING.....he have my trust and I wouldn't let him down for no reason plus his secret is safe with me...	It really depends on what had happened, she would have to tell me the story and I would have to be able to sympathize with her and understand why she did what she did. If I truly felt that she was remorseful for what she did and I can sympathize with her about why she committed murder than maybe I could forgive her and not turn her in.
arg33255_arg33298	o7_2	Love is much greater then any mistake. I know things happen but my wife will be able to confide in me no matter what goes wrong. I made a commitment to stay whit her through rough times and I will. Murder is a unforgivable mistake but love is not.	If it was the person you truly love and want to spend the rest of your life with then it's a definitely no. People make mistakes but although it's a major crime to murder someone I would still not turn in the person I love the most. If I plan on staying with that person I love for the rest of my life then I would stick with them and never turn them in. And if that means that I am part of that murder by not saying anything, well then so be it.
arg33341_arg33346	o8_1	If my spouse committed murder I would not turn him in.

arg33296_arg33226	o8_1	If my husband had committed a murder I think I would not turn him in because my feelings would be stronger that the fear of having a bad husband, I am not sure of my exact answer but I am sure that I couldn't look at him everyday and act like nothing happened, I believe that feeling are stronger than anything and I would not like the fact that he would probably be sentenced to death or spend the rest of his life in prison.

No way, <br/> That's even better than a prenup :) <br/> her: "I'm leaving you and taking half your shit." <br/> me: "Hope you like prison b*^#h"
arg33243_arg33343	o9_2,o7_2	No I wouldn't tell on him because you never know what the reason might be for him to kill that person or it could have been for self defense for all we know and if the people come question me about anything I DON'T KNOW NOTHING.....he have my trust and I wouldn't let him down for no reason plus his secret is safe with me...	I would turn him in because he murdered someone. Don't get me worng I would try to persuade him first to turn himself in but if that didn't happen I would have to take reponsiblity for him. Plus I wouldn't want to feel the guilt of always knowing that I didn't turn that murder in. If he truly loved me I wouldn't have killed someone.
arg33296_arg33270	o9_2	No. I couldn't imagine turning on my spouse like that. I know if i were to do something like that she will be right there next to me not saying a word. Plus if she were to kill someone it would be for a good reason.	If my husband had committed a murder I think I would not turn him in because my feelings would be stronger that the fear of having a bad husband, I am not sure of my exact answer but I am sure that I couldn't look at him everyday and act like nothing happened, I believe that feeling are stronger than anything and I would not like the fact that he would probably be sentenced to death or spend the rest of his life in prison.
arg33270_arg33279	o8_1	It really depends on what had happened, she would have to tell me the story and I would have to be able to sympathize with her and understand why she did what she did. If I truly felt that she was remorseful for what she did and I can sympathize with her about why she committed murder than maybe I could forgive her and not turn her in.	No. I couldn't imagine turning on my spouse like that. I know if i were to do something like that she will be right there next to me not saying a word. Plus if she were to kill someone it would be for a good reason.
arg33373_arg33333	o5_2	No. I wouldn't be able to turn them in. If you truly love someone you would do anything to help them. Especially if it was an accident. <br/> Though, if he killed some one just because he felt like killing somone it may be a little different, because I wouldnt want him to go nuts and kill me too.	I really dont have an exact yes or no answer to this question depending on the situation. If It really got all out of hand and the police new it was my man that did it and they got all the evidence and witnesses that prove it was him that convicted the crime then yes I would turn him in. If they know its him then its just a matter of time.
arg33285_arg33298	o8_1,o7_2	If it was the person you truly love and want to spend the rest of your life with then it's a definitely no. People make mistakes but although it's a major crime to murder someone I would still not turn in the person I love the most. If I plan on staying with that person I love for the rest of my life then I would stick with them and never turn them in. And if that means that I am part of that murder by not saying anything, well then so be it.	No I wouldn't turn in my spouse. Just because the girl that i married killed someone doesn't make them a terrible person. People make mistakes.
arg33302_arg33265	o8_1,o8_5	No way, Marriage (in my eyes) is supposed to be a Bond/Partnership. <br/> Not that I'm calling anyone who would turn his or her spouse in to police <br/> A "Snitch" or a rat, but If my wife where to kill someone,' <br/> I wouldnt hesitate to flex the 5th amendment! Murder Is a heavy offense <br/> But Remember, when you say "I DO", you're basically inviting the person <br/> You're marrying into the Family. So ask yourself... would YOU turn in FAMILY?? <br/> If so, join the police force. If not, kudos! (I would still divorce the crazy chick though!)	I would not turn him in unless he killed a more than one because there is no way it could be an accident more than once. I think if i loved the person enough i could hide the facts and act like it never happened.
arg33252_arg33237	o5_2,o7_1	If my wife was to commit murder and told me about it. I wouldnt turn her in because if you really love her then you would have her back through anything good or bad.	If I do that, then who's going to cook and clean house? Who's gonna have sex with me? I'm too old to do the dating scene all over again. Besides, you don't specify who she killed or why. Maybe she had her reasons. Not everyone deserves to live, you know? ;)
arg33237_arg33328	o8_5,o7_4	If my wife was to commit murder and told me about it. I wouldnt turn her in because if you really love her then you would have her back through anything good or bad.	Well it all pretty much depends....Like if she killed someone that deserved it well it would still be scary to sleep with them so this a maybe / maybe not situation... So yeah im not to sure
arg33226_arg33252	o8_1,o5_2	I wouldnt turn her in becuase she is my wife. She made a mistake that we can get over it. If she trusted me by telling me what she did then I couldn't do that to her.	If I do that, then who's going to cook and clean house? Who's gonna have sex with me? I'm too old to do the dating scene all over again. Besides, you don't specify who she killed or why. Maybe she had her reasons. Not everyone deserves to live, you know? ;)
arg33320_arg33252	o5_1	I dont believe i would turn them in because of love.But i certainly would not stay with her; i would move away from her as far as i could.For the simple reason i wouldnt want to be involed with the crime, because i knew about it.	If I do that, then who's going to cook and clean house? Who's gonna have sex with me? I'm too old to do the dating scene all over again. Besides, you don't specify who she killed or why.

arg33259_arg33326	o5_2	No I would not turn them in, because it would be to weird for me to turn them in to the police. I would probably wouldn't tell anybody. I would hope that the police catch them but I would not say anything. I would tell them to turn their self in.	All I want to say to the spouses of the people on this side of the debate, "Don't confide in your spouse and tell them that you killed somebody; they'll turn you in! And if they find out on their own, take them out before they turn you in!" ;)
arg33319_arg33353	o5_2,o7_2	I really don't know because i think it depends on who she murdered and how it happened. If it was self defense then no I wouldn't tell the police, but if she just went crazy and murdered someone then yes i would tell the police.	No, I wouldn't turn my spouse in I would just be like. You told me I had know part in it. And we are just going to go our separate ways. But truthfully I wouldn't want to know in the first place.

arg33225_arg33262	o8_1,o9_3	Of course not! Absolutely not! Its something that happened, a mistake she made, and something she would definitely learn from. She was strong enough to tell me about it, something not a lot of people of would done. I'm pretty sure that's not easy for someone to do. Anyone else would of just kept to themselves and not tell anyone. If that were to ever happen, which I strongly doubt, I would definitely support her and be with her, no matter what!	I dont think i could turn my spouse in, or my family and friends if they committed a murder because those people are way to close to me and i couldnt picture my life without any of them. Why would anyone send away someone they love, i think that is wong especialy if you live with the person.
arg33306_arg33300	o8_1	If my husband where to commit a murder I would most likely not turn him in. He's my husband and I'm going to be there for him for better or for worst. Yes he made a big mistake and he should pay for it I know that but i don't think I'll have the heart to turn in the man I love. We have to protect each other and be their for each other no matter how bad it is. Even if it makes me his accomplice.	No I would not because i would have taken a vow say to stick by them in sickness and health. They might be sick in the head but she would be my wife. If anything id be trying to find a way to keep her from getting caught.
arg33346_arg33302	o8_1	No. I would not turn my spouse in. I would try to convince him to do the right thing and turn his own self in. But i dont see it as my place to go and turn him in. but it also depends on the reason behind him killing someone. it just cant be some random killing because i would turn him in for that for the fact that i would think that i would be next to get killed.	I would not turn him in unless he killed a more than one because there is no way it could be an accident more than once.

Well I definitely would stick by my vows of marriage through the good times and the bad but I mean some people get married without truly knowing who the person is. Hmmm that is a hard one. Well if I truly loved this person I would not turn them in because, I mean I made a promise to them that they could turn to me for help in thick and thin till death do us part.

And if that means that I am part of that murder by not saying anything, well then so be it.	Well it all pretty much depends....Like if she killed someone that deserved it well it would still be scary to sleep with them so this a maybe / maybe not situation... So yeah im not to sure
arg33283_arg33328	o7_4	I wouldn't turn my wife in because I love her and married her for a reason. I would trust my wife that she killed someone for a good reason, relatively because murder is still murder. Gene hackman killed the guy her wife was cheating with.

arg33300_arg33326	o7_4	If my husband where to commit a murder I would most likely not turn him in. He's my husband and I'm going to be there for him for better or for worst. Yes he made a big mistake and he should pay for it I know that but i don't think I'll have the heart to turn in the man I love. We have to protect each other and be their for each other no matter how bad it is. Even if it makes me his accomplice.	No I would not turn them in, because it would be to weird for me to turn them in to the police. I would probably wouldn't tell anybody. I would hope that the police catch them but I would not say anything. I would tell them to turn their self in.

If anything id be trying to find a way to keep her from getting caught.	No, I wouldn't turn my spouse in I would just be like. You told me I had know part in it. And we are just going to go our separate ways. But truthfully I wouldn't want to know in the first place.
arg33306_arg33285	o8_1	No I would not because i would have taken a vow say to stick by them in sickness and health. They might be sick in the head but she would be my wife.

People make mistakes.
arg33242_arg33270	o8_5	No. I couldn't imagine turning on my spouse like that. I know if i were to do something like that she will be right there next to me not saying a word.

But on the flip side, if it was just down right cold blooded murder, yes I would turn them in.
arg33320_arg33279	o8_1	It really depends on what had happened, she would have to tell me the story and I would have to be able to sympathize with her and understand why she did what she did. If I truly felt that she was remorseful for what she did and I can sympathize with her about why she committed murder than maybe I could forgive her and not turn her in.

arg33242_arg33343	o8_1,o7_4	I would turn him in because he murdered someone. Don't get me worng I would try to persuade him first to turn himself in but if that didn't happen I would have to take reponsiblity for him. Plus I wouldn't want to feel the guilt of always knowing that I didn't turn that murder in. If he truly loved me I wouldn't have killed someone.	More than likely I would not turn in my spouse, because there is that love that binds us together. But on the flip side, if it was just down right cold blooded murder, yes I would turn them in.
arg33270_arg33320	o6_3	No. I couldn't imagine turning on my spouse like that. I know if i were to do something like that she will be right there next to me not saying a word. Plus if she were to kill someone it would be for a good reason.	I dont believe i would turn them in because of love.But i certainly would not stay with her; i would move away from her as far as i could.For the simple reason i wouldnt want to be involed with the crime, because i knew about it.
arg33257_arg33302	o8_1	Well I definitely would stick by my vows of marriage through the good times and the bad but I mean some people get married without truly knowing who the person is. Hmmm that is a hard one. Well if I truly loved this person I would not turn them in because, I mean I made a promise to them that they could turn to me for help in thick and thin till death do us part. But there are divorces that happen all the time because for whatever reason, but I don't know this is a toughy.	I would not turn him in unless he killed a more than one because there is no way it could be an accident more than once. I think if i loved the person enough i could hide the facts and act like it never happened.
arg33333_arg33306	o9_1	No I would not because i would have taken a vow say to stick by them in sickness and health. They might be sick in the head but she would be my wife. If anything id be trying to find a way to keep her from getting caught.	No. I wouldn't be able to turn them in. If you truly love someone you would do anything to help them. Especially if it was an accident. <br/> Though, if he killed some one just because he felt like killing somone it may be a little different, because I wouldnt want him to go nuts and kill me too.
arg33243_arg33354	o8_1	No I would not turn in my spouse because when you get married you promise to be there for eachother through good or through worse and I would anything to help her but, don't get me wrong though if my spouse were to get caught I will not go down with her because most likley I would have a family to take care of and would not leave them for anything.	No I wouldn't tell on him because you never know what the reason might be for him to kill that person or it could have been for self defense for all we know and if the people come question me about anything I DON'T KNOW NOTHING.....he have my trust and I wouldn't let him down for no reason plus his secret is safe with me...
arg33302_arg33279	o8_1	It really depends on what had happened, she would have to tell me the story and I would have to be able to sympathize with her and understand why she did what she did. If I truly felt that she was remorseful for what she did and I can sympathize with her about why she committed murder than maybe I could forgive her and not turn her in.	I would not turn him in unless he killed a more than one because there is no way it could be an accident more than once. I think if i loved the person enough i could hide the facts and act like it never happened.
arg33237_arg33242	o7_4	If my wife was to commit murder and told me about it. I wouldnt turn her in because if you really love her then you would have her back through anything good or bad.

arg33288_arg33319	o8_1,o8_5,o7_4	As human beings, we are selfish and have been fabricated with a survival mechanism that tell is to do whatever whenever to protect the ones that we love. I would do everything in my power to protect my love, even if that means taking this horrible secret to the grave.	I really don't know because i think it depends on who she murdered and how it happened. If it was self defense then no I wouldn't tell the police, but if she just went crazy and murdered someone then yes i would tell the police.
arg33283_arg33257	o8_5	I wouldn't turn my wife in because I love her and married her for a reason. I would trust my wife that she killed someone for a good reason, relatively because murder is still murder. Gene hackman killed the guy her wife was cheating with.	Well I definitely would stick by my vows of marriage through the good times and the bad but I mean some people get married without truly knowing who the person is. Hmmm that is a hard one. Well if I truly loved this person I would not turn them in because, I mean I made a promise to them that they could turn to me for help in thick and thin till death do us part.

No I wouldn't turn in my spouse. Just because the girl that i married killed someone doesn't make them a terrible person. People make mistakes.
arg33328_arg33346	o8_1,o9_2,o9_4	No. I would not turn my spouse in. I would try to convince him to do the right thing and turn his own self in. But i dont see it as my place to go and turn him in. but it also depends on the reason behind him killing someone. it just cant be some random killing because i would turn him in for that for the fact that i would think that i would be next to get killed.	Well it all pretty much depends....Like if she killed someone that deserved it well it would still be scary to sleep with them so this a maybe / maybe not situation... So yeah im not to sure
arg33346_arg33225	o8_1,o9_2,o7_1	No. I would not turn my spouse in. I would try to convince him to do the right thing and turn his own self in. But i dont see it as my place to go and turn him in. but it also depends on the reason behind him killing someone. it just cant be some random killing because i would turn him in for that for the fact that i would think that i would be next to get killed.	I dont think i could turn my spouse in, or my family and friends if they committed a murder because those people are way to close to me and i couldnt picture my life without any of them. Why would anyone send away someone they love, i think that is wong especialy if you live with the person.
arg33237_arg33300	o8_1	If my husband where to commit a murder I would most likely not turn him in. He's my husband and I'm going to be there for him for better or for worst. Yes he made a big mistake and he should pay for it I know that but i don't think I'll have the heart to turn in the man I love. We have to protect each other and be their for each other no matter how bad it is. Even if it makes me his accomplice.	If my wife was to commit murder and told me about it. I wouldnt turn her in because if you really love her then you would have her back through anything good or bad.
arg33296_arg33283	o8_1,o7_2	I wouldn't turn my wife in because I love her and married her for a reason. I would trust my wife that she killed someone for a good reason, relatively because murder is still murder. Gene hackman killed the guy her wife was cheating with.	If my husband had committed a murder I think I would not turn him in because my feelings would be stronger that the fear of having a bad husband, I am not sure of my exact answer but I am sure that I couldn't look at him everyday and act like nothing happened, I believe that feeling are stronger than anything and I would not like the fact that he would probably be sentenced to death or spend the rest of his life in prison.
arg33306_arg33298	o8_4,o9_1,o6_1	If it was the person you truly love and want to spend the rest of your life with then it's a definitely no. People make mistakes but although it's a major crime to murder someone I would still not turn in the person I love the most. If I plan on staying with that person I love for the rest of my life then I would stick with them and never turn them in. And if that means that I am part of that murder by not saying anything, well then so be it.	No I would not because i would have taken a vow say to stick by them in sickness and health. They might be sick in the head but she would be my wife. If anything id be trying to find a way to keep her from getting caught.
arg33262_arg33288	o8_5	As human beings, we are selfish and have been fabricated with a survival mechanism that tell is to do whatever whenever to protect the ones that we love. I would do everything in my power to protect my love, even if that means taking this horrible secret to the grave.	Of course not! Absolutely not! Its something that happened, a mistake she made, and something she would definitely learn from. She was strong enough to tell me about it, something not a lot of people of would done. I'm pretty sure that's not easy for someone to do. Anyone else would of just kept to themselves and not tell anyone. If that were to ever happen, which I strongly doubt, I would definitely support her and be with her, no matter what!
arg33252_arg33328	o8_1,o7_4	If I do that, then who's going to cook and clean house? Who's gonna have sex with me? I'm too old to do the dating scene all over again. Besides, you don't specify who she killed or why. Maybe she had her reasons.

If I truly felt that she was remorseful for what she did and I can sympathize with her about why she committed murder than maybe I could forgive her and not turn her in.	I wouldnt turn her in becuase she is my wife. She made a mistake that we can get over it. If she trusted me by telling me what she did then I couldn't do that to her.
arg33283_arg33346	o9_3	I wouldn't turn my wife in because I love her and married her for a reason. I would trust my wife that she killed someone for a good reason, relatively because murder is still murder. Gene hackman killed the guy her wife was cheating with.	No. I would not turn my spouse in. I would try to convince him to do the right thing and turn his own self in. But i dont see it as my place to go and turn him in. but it also depends on the reason behind him killing someone. it just cant be some random killing because i would turn him in for that for the fact that i would think that i would be next to get killed.

If my husband committed murder I wouldn't turn them in because I know he must have had a good reason to do it. Everybody makes mistakes in this world and this would be a wrong decision he took. I love him and I feel that in love we should be by your partner throught the thick and thin no matter what. I wouldn't want my husband to be in jail.
