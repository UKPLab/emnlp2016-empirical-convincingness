There have been more Windows than Mac Firefox downloads since day one. <br/> If you are "original and free minded" then why do you use the browser with a 58.6% market share? How is using the browser everyone else does "original"? <br/> It's not even worth rebutting the second paragraph of your argument, as it doesn't contain a single fact and really isn't even an argument either.	No match. FF is better for my use in every way.

469_398	o8_1	I can reconfigure Firefox very easily to meet my needs as my life changes. If I need great SEO extensions I can get them. If I need an HTML color picker instead when I get more involved with other elements of site development, FF is easily remodeled to suit my new browsing needs.

477_390	o8_1	firefox is much better. <br/> It remembers passwords with greater gusto. <br/> add-ons allow you to personalize your browser in every way. I love - tabs (aging and remembering them when you close the browser, weatherfox, gestures, <br/> there is even a tab that lets you display the page in IE format if something is incompatible (rare, only SAP at work) <br/> and the way you can put the link logos in the tool bar rocks. <br/> much friendlier and a better browser, and not just because i don't want to support MS. Because i don't care about that, a good product is a good product.	From a design standpoint, Firefox absolutely wins the Pretty Browser battle. <br/> There is such an array of beautiful skins out there for Firefox, and when you add that to the amount of Toolbar and UI customization that Firefox supports, the 'Fox is the clear-cut winner. <br/> And since I assume most of the people debating the superiority of one browser or another are Intraweb junkies, I know everyone uses their browser quite often. <br/> Who wants to look at an ugly UI like that of every IE (7 is the most criminal of them all)?

31493_460	o8_1	Firefox takes the best of all previous browsers and sticks it all in one neat package. Security and extendibility are some of its top features.

I pity those of you on the other side. The annoying load of pop ups and viruses IE has, yet you continue to use it?! <br/> Main reason I love Firefox has to be the tab option. The last time I checked IE requires you to get up a whole new browser in order search two websites at the same time.
