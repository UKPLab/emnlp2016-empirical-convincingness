No. Are gay marriages in anyway affecting anyone but the two getting married? No. Then why the hell do straight ppl get so offensive? If you want marrage to just be between you fine let them do something else to show they love each other. Bottom line, if you love someone you should be allowed to be with them. God accepts everyone, his people should follow that. Bottom line, it should be a sin to kep two people who love each other apart. Enough said.	EVERYONE, regardless of sexual orientation, has the right to be miserable. I say let gay people know the joys of divorce, splitting of assets, custody, alimony, child support, the whole nine yards! In fact, make civil unions illegal; it makes it too easy to "walk away" from a relationship and encourages roomates to be "couples" to help a buddy out with benefits.Civil Unions, gone, Gay marraige, IN!
594_519	o8_1,o8_4	I don't care if calling it "marriage" offends people, or violates what they call the sanctity of marriage, gays should have the same RIGHTS that a married couple gets. Civil Union, Marriage, the coming together of two souls, or whatever you prefer to call it- gays NEED to be recognized on that level. Not allowing this is a violation to the constitution and it's unfortunate that the Supreme Court won't take a case on this because they're leaving it up to the states, yet Bush wanted to make an amendment stating what marriage is...

We should revert back to tribes & slavery - why challenge any assumption?	The "who gives a crap" button was your browser's back button.

The UNITED States of America can only remain united if laws are created with all men and women in mind. To have a law that favors one religion, or lack thereof, over another is the bane of freedom. Secular law is the only law that works. <br/> Leviticus 20:13: "If a man lies with mankind as he does with womankind, they are both commiting an abomination, they shall be put to death, their blood is on their own hands." <br/> There's a loving god, eh?	let me start by saying i feel marriage as an institution is ridiculous and needn't exist, however thats another debate entirely. To me who wishes to get married is wholly irrelevant. Hell i think animals should be allowed to join in holy matrimony as well, it would certainley be an entertaining ceremony. Far more so then any wedding i have ever attended.
738391172_76758	o8_1,o6_1,o7_2	Gay marriage is a lifestyle choice. It may be considered "unnatural", but that is between that person and his/her love interest. Love is all some people have... You can't take that one given right away because it makes you uncomfortable. They want acceptance and understanding. Let them be happy or just ignore it. You don't chose to be gay either. Who would chose to live that way? They are constantly being harrassed and can't be with their loved one. It's unfortunate and cruel. Please be respecful of them. They have done nothing wrong, God created them that way. 3	one reason is just because so many more people agree with this side now
30529_75425	o9_1,o9_3,o5_1	How can anyone say that Gay Marriage is Wrong. It is a personal choice that is made from personal beliefs so who are we to say that gay couples do not have the right to enjoy all of the benefits that straight couples do?	AS LONG AS IT IS NOT DISEASE WE SHOULD ALL BE FINE WITH ITT ITS NOT OUR BUSINESS!!!
594_34494	o8_1,o8_5,o9_1	I don't care if calling it "marriage" offends people, or violates what they call the sanctity of marriage, gays should have the same RIGHTS that a married couple gets. Civil Union, Marriage, the coming together of two souls, or whatever you prefer to call it- gays NEED to be recognized on that level. Not allowing this is a violation to the constitution and it's unfortunate that the Supreme Court won't take a case on this because they're leaving it up to the states, yet Bush wanted to make an amendment stating what marriage is...	let me start by saying i feel marriage as an institution is ridiculous and needn't exist, however thats another debate entirely.

You cannot choose someone's lifestyle because you don't agree with it. You cannot call someone's lifestyle a "choice" when you are not that person and know that homosexuality was not a "choice."

EVERYONE, regardless of sexual orientation, has the right to be miserable. I say let gay people know the joys of divorce, splitting of assets, custody, alimony, child support, the whole nine yards!

No. Are gay marriages in anyway affecting anyone but the two getting married? No. Then why the hell do straight ppl get so offensive? If you want marrage to just be between you fine let them do something else to show they love each other. Bottom line, if you love someone you should be allowed to be with them.

I think it is in a way wrong but it doesn't really make that much of a big difference in society. So if you want to do it go ahead, it is your life, you make the decisions and choices. In some religions it is frowned upon, and i in a way frown upon it myself but dont let that influence your thoughts, just an opinion. <br/> Life is what you want it to be	What is wrong with it, if they want to marry let them.

73473_649	o8_1	If you do not like gay marriage and thing it is wrong then do not watch a gay couple make out. <br/> Who are you to tell people that their veiws are incorrect and that they must change there feelings and that apparently they are wrong. Meanwhile, everyone is entitled to their opinions, but keep them to yourself. Do not try to change others based on your beliefs. It is selfish and takes away self rights.	I have lots of gay friends. I'm all for it! <br/> People should stop being so against it. People can't help it. I've watched shows about it and I can really see how gay people feel.. when people are looking at them and some of them feel like they are being watched. It is just not right. We are all human.
642_79611	o8_1,o9_2	I believe that everyone has a right to be happy. I have two best friends who are gay, one is female and the other is male. I have no problem being around them as well as when they are with their partners. I believe that gay people have every right to get married just as I had the right to get married to my husband. EVERYONE has the right to love who they want to love and even if they are gay they should be able to get married just like people who are straight.	Gays are human beings just like we are. They should have the right to marriage just like we are.
67160_73625	o8_1,o9_3,o5_1	Do gay marriages hurt anyone? No. Do gay marriages kill many people? No. Are gay marriages going to end the world? No. Are gay marriages in anyway affecting anyone but the two getting married? No. Then why the hell do straight ppl get so offensive? If you want marrage to just be between you fine let them do something else to show they love each other. Bottom line, if you love someone you should be allowed to be with them. God accepts everyone, his people should follow that. Bottom line, it should be a sin to kep two people who love each other apart. Enough said.	Just beacuse there gay does not mean that they dont have a right to be happy! how would u feel if you were denied! we live in the 21st centry! everyone else is allowed to get married so why should not they!
77300_30529	o8_1	Gay Marriage. I'm an agnostic so in no way does my religion conflict with this matter. I'm an avid gay rights supporter. Marriage, is said to be the marriage of 2 people who love and care about each other. Some Straight couples just get married for the benefit of getting kids. So is that right in any case? What is the purpose of marriage if 2 people only get married to reap its benefits? I.e Have kids? As we are living in a developing society, more and more and more people are coming to terms and agreeing that gay marriage is ok.	How can anyone say that Gay Marriage is Wrong. It is a personal choice that is made from personal beliefs so who are we to say that gay couples do not have the right to enjoy all of the benefits that straight couples do?

76794_542	o9_2	There is an argument of people saying is gay marriage acceptable or unacceptable. I would say most of the population of Britain would say it is wrong however I think anybody should be allowed to express there feelings to the one they love so I think it is acceptable.

580_68734	o8_4,o9_1	The Bible is not the origin of marriage. Marriage is found in almost every society, including those that were never touched by Christianity (or Judaism) and societies that preceded Christianity (and Judaism). The Bible can only be argued to be the origin of Christian marriage, and even that is difficult to prove.	A person should be free to do as he or she pleases. So in my opinion i really dont care much about gay marriage. I think it is in a way wrong but it doesn't really make that much of a big difference in society. So if you want to do it go ahead, it is your life, you make the decisions and choices. In some religions it is frowned upon, and i in a way frown upon it myself but dont let that influence your thoughts, just an opinion. <br/> Life is what you want it to be
76793_81756	o9_1	I think it all depends on the individualist's point of view. We have no right to go against it. Different people have different point of views.We perceive that Gay marriage is weird and disgusting but they might feel the same way as we do and find that Man and Women marriages are weird. So I think it all depends on perceptions and we have no whats so ever right to question one's perceptions.

What is wrong with it, if they want to marry let them. If were your child or adopted mother/father you'd accept it!!!
63084_80099	o8_1,o6_1,o7_4	Religion, lifestyle etc is a personal choice. If your religion or culture disallows gay marriage, that's fine. It means you don't want to marry a person of the same gender. But then why should it extend to other religions or cultures? Gay people marrying in no way affects your marriage to the opposite gender either, they simply get married and get on with it just like you do.	If straights are allowed to get married and do whatever they want, why cant gays?
1488232624_516	o8_1	honestly who cares - if people want to be together so be it. <br/> it isn't like marriage is some high holy thing - we sell it on tv, in drive throughs, etc. and that is fake love. <br/> If people really want to be together then who are you to tell them no. If you don't like what they do, don't be their friend. <br/> plus what will you do when you kids are gay?	It might be against the teachings of the bible etc... but only because a gay relationship bears no offspring which is why it was banned. <br/> Also it was seen to weaken the position of men. <br/> Time have changed... its time to accept.

530_738391172	o8_1	EVERYONE, regardless of sexual orientation, has the right to be miserable. I say let gay people know the joys of divorce, splitting of assets, custody, alimony, child support, the whole nine yards! In fact, make civil unions illegal; it makes it too easy to "walk away" from a relationship and encourages roomates to be "couples" to help a buddy out with benefits.Civil Unions, gone, Gay marraige, IN!	one reason is just because so many more people agree with this side now

67160_76758	o8_1,o8_4	Gay marriage is a lifestyle choice. It may be considered "unnatural", but that is between that person and his/her love interest. Love is all some people have... You can't take that one given right away because it makes you uncomfortable. They want acceptance and understanding. Let them be happy or just ignore it. You don't chose to be gay either. Who would chose to live that way? They are constantly being harrassed and can't be with their loved one. It's unfortunate and cruel. Please be respecful of them. They have done nothing wrong, God created them that way. 3	Just beacuse there gay does not mean that they dont have a right to be happy! how would u feel if you were denied! we live in the 21st centry! everyone else is allowed to get married so why should not they!
75425_81756	o8_4	I think it all depends on the individualist's point of view. We have no right to go against it. Different people have different point of views.We perceive that Gay marriage is weird and disgusting but they might feel the same way as we do and find that Man and Women marriages are weird. So I think it all depends on perceptions and we have no whats so ever right to question one's perceptions. We humans are very selfish creatures we only view things according to what we think is right and those who go against it we think that they are wrong.	AS LONG AS IT IS NOT DISEASE WE SHOULD ALL BE FINE WITH ITT ITS NOT OUR BUSINESS!!!

80099_77300	o8_1,o8_4,o6_3	Gay Marriage. I'm an agnostic so in no way does my religion conflict with this matter. I'm an avid gay rights supporter. Marriage, is said to be the marriage of 2 people who love and care about each other. Some Straight couples just get married for the benefit of getting kids. So is that right in any case? What is the purpose of marriage if 2 people only get married to reap its benefits? I.e Have kids? As we are living in a developing society, more and more and more people are coming to terms and agreeing that gay marriage is ok.

642_516	o8_1	I believe that everyone has a right to be happy. I have two best friends who are gay, one is female and the other is male. I have no problem being around them as well as when they are with their partners. I believe that gay people have every right to get married just as I had the right to get married to my husband. EVERYONE has the right to love who they want to love and even if they are gay they should be able to get married just like people who are straight.	honestly who cares - if people want to be together so be it. <br/> it isn't like marriage is some high holy thing - we sell it on tv, in drive throughs, etc. and that is fake love. <br/> If people really want to be together then who are you to tell them no.

80510_68734	o8_1,o6_1	A person should be free to do as he or she pleases. So in my opinion i really dont care much about gay marriage. I think it is in a way wrong but it doesn't really make that much of a big difference in society. So if you want to do it go ahead, it is your life, you make the decisions and choices. In some religions it is frowned upon, and i in a way frown upon it myself but dont let that influence your thoughts, just an opinion. <br/> Life is what you want it to be	Dosen't it say in the declaration of independence that we have the right to life liberty and the purist of happiness

No. Are gay marriages in anyway affecting anyone but the two getting married? No. Then why the hell do straight ppl get so offensive? If you want marrage to just be between you fine let them do something else to show they love each other. Bottom line, if you love someone you should be allowed to be with them. God accepts everyone, his people should follow that. Bottom line, it should be a sin to kep two people who love each other apart. Enough said.	Why does it matter? If two people regardless of gender love each other to the point of which the two marry, shouldn't that follow what the bible really teaches us. <br/> All you bible nutjobes by the way are making me sick.

594_73473	o8_1	I don't care if calling it "marriage" offends people, or violates what they call the sanctity of marriage, gays should have the same RIGHTS that a married couple gets. Civil Union, Marriage, the coming together of two souls, or whatever you prefer to call it- gays NEED to be recognized on that level. Not allowing this is a violation to the constitution and it's unfortunate that the Supreme Court won't take a case on this because they're leaving it up to the states, yet Bush wanted to make an amendment stating what marriage is...	If you do not like gay marriage and thing it is wrong then do not watch a gay couple make out. <br/> Who are you to tell people that their veiws are incorrect and that they must change there feelings and that apparently they are wrong. Meanwhile, everyone is entitled to their opinions, but keep them to yourself. Do not try to change others based on your beliefs. It is selfish and takes away self rights.

This is not a commonly known fact - Can you point me to a reference? <br/> Or do you mean that gay _sex_ is helping spread AIDS? In which case gay marriage may help reduce the problem.
649_76758	o8_4,o9_3	Gay marriage is a lifestyle choice. It may be considered "unnatural", but that is between that person and his/her love interest. Love is all some people have...

76758_81756	o8_1	Gay marriage is a lifestyle choice. It may be considered "unnatural", but that is between that person and his/her love interest. Love is all some people have... You can't take that one given right away because it makes you uncomfortable. They want acceptance and understanding. Let them be happy or just ignore it. You don't chose to be gay either. Who would chose to live that way? They are constantly being harrassed and can't be with their loved one. It's unfortunate and cruel. Please be respecful of them. They have done nothing wrong, God created them that way. 3	I think it all depends on the individualist's point of view. We have no right to go against it. Different people have different point of views.We perceive that Gay marriage is weird and disgusting but they might feel the same way as we do and find that Man and Women marriages are weird. So I think it all depends on perceptions and we have no whats so ever right to question one's perceptions. We humans are very selfish creatures we only view things according to what we think is right and those who go against it we think that they are wrong.

Marriage is found in almost every society, including those that were never touched by Christianity (or Judaism) and societies that preceded Christianity (and Judaism). The Bible can only be argued to be the origin of Christian marriage, and even that is difficult to prove.	Just beacuse there gay does not mean that they dont have a right to be happy! how would u feel if you were denied! we live in the 21st centry! everyone else is allowed to get married so why should not they!
77300_32993	o8_1	Gay Marriage. I'm an agnostic so in no way does my religion conflict with this matter. I'm an avid gay rights supporter. Marriage, is said to be the marriage of 2 people who love and care about each other. Some Straight couples just get married for the benefit of getting kids. So is that right in any case? What is the purpose of marriage if 2 people only get married to reap its benefits? I.e Have kids? As we are living in a developing society, more and more and more people are coming to terms and agreeing that gay marriage is ok.	Why does it matter? If two people regardless of gender love each other to the point of which the two marry, shouldn't that follow what the bible really teaches us. <br/> All you bible nutjobes by the way are making me sick. The bible teaches love and forgiveness, and lets not forget dont judge others before you judge yourself.
642_68734	o9_3,o7_2	I believe that everyone has a right to be happy. I have two best friends who are gay, one is female and the other is male. I have no problem being around them as well as when they are with their partners. I believe that gay people have every right to get married just as I had the right to get married to my husband. EVERYONE has the right to love who they want to love and even if they are gay they should be able to get married just like people who are straight.	A person should be free to do as he or she pleases. So in my opinion i really dont care much about gay marriage. I think it is in a way wrong but it doesn't really make that much of a big difference in society. So if you want to do it go ahead, it is your life, you make the decisions and choices. In some religions it is frowned upon, and i in a way frown upon it myself but dont let that influence your thoughts, just an opinion. <br/> Life is what you want it to be

There is an argument of people saying is gay marriage acceptable or unacceptable. I would say most of the population of Britain would say it is wrong however I think anybody should be allowed to express there feelings to the one they love so I think it is acceptable. Because how come we can get married to the other secuality however a man can't express his feelings to a man or a woman and a woman as gay sexuality I think gays should be allowed to do what they like when they like !!

What is wrong with it, if they want to marry let them. If were your child or adopted mother/father you'd accept it!!!
530_73324	o8_1,o6_1	EVERYONE, regardless of sexual orientation, has the right to be miserable. I say let gay people know the joys of divorce, splitting of assets, custody, alimony, child support, the whole nine yards! In fact, make civil unions illegal; it makes it too easy to "walk away" from a relationship and encourages roomates to be "couples" to help a buddy out with benefits.Civil Unions, gone, Gay marraige, IN!	What is wrong with it, if they want to marry let them. If were your child or adopted mother/father you'd accept it!!!
79611_30529	o9_1	How can anyone say that Gay Marriage is Wrong. It is a personal choice that is made from personal beliefs so who are we to say that gay couples do not have the right to enjoy all of the benefits that straight couples do?	Gays are human beings just like we are. They should have the right to marriage just like we are.
73473_76758	o8_1	Gay marriage is a lifestyle choice. It may be considered "unnatural", but that is between that person and his/her love interest. Love is all some people have... You can't take that one given right away because it makes you uncomfortable. They want acceptance and understanding. Let them be happy or just ignore it. You don't chose to be gay either. Who would chose to live that way? They are constantly being harrassed and can't be with their loved one. It's unfortunate and cruel. Please be respecful of them. They have done nothing wrong, God created them that way. 3	If you do not like gay marriage and thing it is wrong then do not watch a gay couple make out. <br/> Who are you to tell people that their veiws are incorrect and that they must change there feelings and that apparently they are wrong. Meanwhile, everyone is entitled to their opinions, but keep them to yourself. Do not try to change others based on your beliefs. It is selfish and takes away self rights.
516_32993	o5_1	honestly who cares - if people want to be together so be it. <br/> it isn't like marriage is some high holy thing - we sell it on tv, in drive throughs, etc. and that is fake love. <br/> If people really want to be together then who are you to tell them no. If you don't like what they do, don't be their friend. <br/> plus what will you do when you kids are gay?	Why does it matter? If two people regardless of gender love each other to the point of which the two marry, shouldn't that follow what the bible really teaches us. <br/> All you bible nutjobes by the way are making me sick. The bible teaches love and forgiveness, and lets not forget dont judge others before you judge yourself.
580_33506	o8_1	First of all, gays have the fundamental right of equal happiness. Second of all, they are still part of society. Third of all, the government would have a better image if we allow the third gender to have the equal right of marriage. Also, it only proves that racism, sexism and hatred is non existent.	The Bible is not the origin of marriage. Marriage is found in almost every society, including those that were never touched by Christianity (or Judaism) and societies that preceded Christianity (and Judaism). The Bible can only be argued to be the origin of Christian marriage, and even that is difficult to prove.
63084_46238	o8_1	Gay marriage bans, along with other laws, are only in place because of the religious right that seems to be infecting this country. The UNITED States of America can only remain united if laws are created with all men and women in mind. To have a law that favors one religion, or lack thereof, over another is the bane of freedom. Secular law is the only law that works. <br/> Leviticus 20:13: "If a man lies with mankind as he does with womankind, they are both commiting an abomination, they shall be put to death, their blood is on their own hands." <br/> There's a loving god, eh?	Religion, lifestyle etc is a personal choice. If your religion or culture disallows gay marriage, that's fine. It means you don't want to marry a person of the same gender. But then why should it extend to other religions or cultures? Gay people marrying in no way affects your marriage to the opposite gender either, they simply get married and get on with it just like you do.

Mosy who do not want it to be allowed just dont like homosexuality all together, and therefore the opposing side tends to be prejudice. If two men or two women are happy together, love each other, and want to be with each other forever why shouldn't they be allowed to get married??
76793_80510	o5_2,o6_1	Dosen't it say in the declaration of independence that we have the right to life liberty and the purist of happiness	There is an argument of people saying is gay marriage acceptable or unacceptable. I would say most of the population of Britain would say it is wrong however I think anybody should be allowed to express there feelings to the one they love so I think it is acceptable. Because how come we can get married to the other secuality however a man can't express his feelings to a man or a woman and a woman as gay sexuality I think gays should be allowed to do what they like when they like !!

73625_649	o8_1,o9_2	Do gay marriages hurt anyone? No. Do gay marriages kill many people? No. Are gay marriages going to end the world? No. Are gay marriages in anyway affecting anyone but the two getting married? No. Then why the hell do straight ppl get so offensive? If you want marrage to just be between you fine let them do something else to show they love each other. Bottom line, if you love someone you should be allowed to be with them. God accepts everyone, his people should follow that. Bottom line, it should be a sin to kep two people who love each other apart. Enough said.	I have lots of gay friends. I'm all for it! <br/> People should stop being so against it. People can't help it. I've watched shows about it and I can really see how gay people feel.. when people are looking at them and some of them feel like they are being watched. It is just not right. We are all human.

79007_34494	o8_4,o7_1	You cannot choose someone's lifestyle because you don't agree with it. You cannot call someone's lifestyle a "choice" when you are not that person and know that homosexuality was not a "choice."	let me start by saying i feel marriage as an institution is ridiculous and needn't exist, however thats another debate entirely. To me who wishes to get married is wholly irrelevant. Hell i think animals should be allowed to join in holy matrimony as well, it would certainley be an entertaining ceremony. Far more so then any wedding i have ever attended.
