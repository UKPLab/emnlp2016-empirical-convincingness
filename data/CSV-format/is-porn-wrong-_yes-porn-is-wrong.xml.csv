39342_2473	o8_1	The argument that porn would expose one to the reality in life, and thus increasing one's maturity and prevent possible future sexual assaults, is totally crap. <br/> porn is definitely wrong. after a dosage, the guilt of wasting ur time, wasting energy, wasting effort and not devoting urself to another thing and regretting that you should not have started would almost kill you. trust me. <br/> its a road that shld not be taken, its as bad as smoking and dugs. i think the only reason its not banned in most developed countries is that they are facing an aging population.	porn is wrong..... <br/> it's wrong 'cause it's not any good. <br/> if it were REALLY good, then it would REALLY be wrong.

But all of us have been lustful before, right? I'm not judging you, but it is wrong and you should stop.	Even though humans have sexual desires, it doesn't mean people you don't even know should watch you in pornographic content. Have sexual desires to the one you love.
39342_54187	o8_1,o9_1,o5_2,o6_1	If one is in a relationship then yes porn is wrong. No one has the right to tell others what to do, we can only hope to influence. Porn is disgusting. Seriously.

32588_2471	o8_1,o6_1,o7_2	is it wrong? yes. unhealthy? yes. Addictive? yes. but so is smoking ciggarettes. just because its wrong doesn't mean it shouldn't exist.	Porn is wrong.. <br/> If people Watch it... We will want to do a free sex... Free Sex will bring a disease especially HIV... <br/> In Morallity it is wrong...
54187_2137504198	o8_1	This not only degrades morality, it also affects how women are treated in society today. This is against women empowerment in a sense that women are viewed merely as sex toys. Which at the end of the day affects how men perceive women which will in turn lead to a lot of disrespect and false perception. <br/> Now, how about crime rates? Murders, Rape, and Sexual Abuse. According to studies, all these people who committed these grave crimes all had one thing in common: PORN.	If one is in a relationship then yes porn is wrong. No one has the right to tell others what to do, we can only hope to influence. Porn is disgusting. Seriously. It exploits men and women. It is not realistic and can split up relationships. <br/> If a man and a woman or a woman and a woman or man and a man are in a relationship then they should not need any other forms of sexual gratification other than their spouse. Out of love. And respect.
25796815_2474	o7_1	What do you see in porn? <br/> -> sex <br/> What is sex for? <br/> -> baby making <br/> why should you watch others make baby? <br/> -> pleasure <br/> what causes pleasure? <br/> -> temptation <br/> what do you do to control temptation? <br/> -> then do it... <br/> conclusion: Porn is in a situation where there is temptation to increase the population of the next generation... wow.	depending on your beleifs <br/> because im christian i beleave it is <br/> but to someone eles whos not christian it may be completly ok
50112_71943	o7_3	well, the people who watch porn, <br/> i guess thats ok, its NORMAL. <br/> but the people who are <br/> IN the porn, that is not normal.. <br/> i read it in a abnormal psychology book, <br/> that means they have a disorder	porn is wrong.............. unless it has smoken hot lesbians in it <br/> in fact i am downloading porn even as i type
39342_1889622141	o8_1	The argument that porn would expose one to the reality in life, and thus increasing one's maturity and prevent possible future sexual assaults, is totally crap. <br/> porn is definitely wrong. after a dosage, the guilt of wasting ur time, wasting energy, wasting effort and not devoting urself to another thing and regretting that you should not have started would almost kill you. trust me. <br/> its a road that shld not be taken, its as bad as smoking and dugs. i think the only reason its not banned in most developed countries is that they are facing an aging population.	It is wrong. Porn is wrong because you are being lustful: it's even more wrong when you're married because you're looking at another person in a preverted way that's not your wife or husband, which believe it or not, counts as cheating on them. But all of us have been lustful before, right? I'm not judging you, but it is wrong and you should stop.
1607563438_71821	o7_2	Are you a Christian...or anything? If not, than hey who's to stop you! For the record, yeah it's wrong. Unfortunately, it's impossible to argue that, if you and the opposing individual refuse to share the same beliefs. Hence, my first point.	PORN iS WRONG WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO WATCH PEOPLE HAVE SEX!! MAYBE EVERYONE FEEL DIFFERENT BUT STILL IF YU WANNA WATCH PEOPLE HAVE SEX GET A MIRROR AND HAVE SEX AND LOOK AT YUR SELF...CUZ KIDS OUT HERE R WATCHIN IT AND DOIN THE WRONG THINGS!
25796815_79609	o8_4,o5_3,o7_2	Even though humans have sexual desires, it doesn't mean people you don't even know should watch you in pornographic content. Have sexual desires to the one you love.	What do you see in porn? <br/> -> sex <br/> What is sex for? <br/> -> baby making <br/> why should you watch others make baby? <br/> -> pleasure <br/> what causes pleasure? <br/> -> temptation <br/> what do you do to control temptation? <br/> -> then do it... <br/> conclusion: Porn is in a situation where there is temptation to increase the population of the next generation... wow.

39342_29393	o8_1,o6_1,o7_1	Porn is wrong when it is not done in moderation. Porn addicts turn out to have intimacy issues in their relationships and mistreat and view women in a negative manner. Also people who are addicted to porn, expect all women to look like porn stars and act like porn stars, when in reality that is not what sex is about... But it tends to screw up their reality.	The argument that porn would expose one to the reality in life, and thus increasing one's maturity and prevent possible future sexual assaults, is totally crap. <br/> porn is definitely wrong. after a dosage, the guilt of wasting ur time, wasting energy, wasting effort and not devoting urself to another thing and regretting that you should not have started would almost kill you. trust me. <br/> its a road that shld not be taken, its as bad as smoking and dugs. i think the only reason its not banned in most developed countries is that they are facing an aging population.
