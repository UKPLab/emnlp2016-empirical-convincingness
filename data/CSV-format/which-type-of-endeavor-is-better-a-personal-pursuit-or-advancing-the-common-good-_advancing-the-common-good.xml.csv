arg33060_arg33139	o9_1,o7_4	I think that advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit. The reason for this is that it is better to help others than just to think about yourself. We need to improve our community first before we think about ourselves. If everyone tried to take care of their community then there would be no dangerous places.	There once was a rapper who said he was the people's Champ. When wanting to be successful sometimes you need to worry about the common good because that's what people want.

arg33155_arg33114	o8_1,o9_1	Advancing the Common good is a better endeavor than a personal pursuit. For example there are those who want to help others. A personal pursuit however is only for those selfish people who only care about themselves. The common good happens to some from a loan for college, to a charity for an orphanage, a school, etc	i believe they are diffenrent ways of feeling happy and proud of what you do, i feel happy helping others that doesnt means i help every person in front of me, i try to do what i think is best and good to make somebody happy.

arg33092_arg33084	o8_1,o9_1	Whether you are in a venture purely for yourself or others, you still end up affecting the people around you. <br/> When asking someone why they decide to help with the common good, the response would be something along the lines of, "it feels good to help out." <br/> Ultimately, people don't help out people unless they get some sort of satisfaction out of it, be it whether they community service hours, material rewards, fame, or just having the satisfaction of knowing that you have importance. So when helping out others, you make others feel good as well as yourself.	I think the common good is a better endeavor, because it's better to give then to receive. It's better to give other people you're hand out in help then you holding your own hand.
arg33139_arg33147	o7_3	In my opinion, i think that advancing the common good is better because when helping others, not only is it appreciated by that person or people, but it makes you feel better as well.

However, a person that helps the community and puts other people in front of themselves will most surely live a better life. If you really think about it, advancing the common good is basically a win-win situation. You get the support of other people, and you can also get recognition for yourself as a reward for your help.	I think common good is better than personal pursuit because its better to help other people. I feel good when i help people because it makes me feel happy that im doing something good in life.
arg33177_arg33135	o8_1,o8_5	I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people.

Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know.

I say the common good because of the type of forces that you can make as a whole group. like that person that says that by not voting they are not making a difference and when you look at the whole the population or percentage is bigger than of those who did vote.

When people do something for the good of others it helps them out in the long run. Whether it is a favor in return or anything else. In a personal pursuit you are just helping yourself. If we all just helped ourselves where would our world be? We all depend on others for help at some point. This world should be about others, not just me.	I strongly believe that helping yourself is not a selfish thing to do. If everyone took care of themselves and tried to make themselves better people then there would be no use of common good.

arg33134_arg33177	o7_1	Usually my decision in the end is yes and no,or goes both ways. Today, however it is advancing for the common good. Making a decision to better suit yourself will help you for that moment, but in the long run who will it really help? Whereas, if you make an advancement for the common good you help yourself and other people. If you think about it we all want the world to be a "better place", and if you've noticed personal endeavors have gotten "us" into some not so happy predicaments.	Well, I take the perspective of my parents, because of the way they try to make me, my brother, the rest of the family and friends happy. they would spend all of there money and time on others than themselves.

arg33061_arg33178	o8_1,o6_1	Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass.

arg33061_arg33176	o7_4	Advancing the common good is much better.

arg33114_arg33082	o8_1	Both endeavors are better to be part of.But I as an individual I would like to advance the common good in this society to become unpetty with each other,to do things way better than they use to.Everyone in this world knows what they want to be. To be alone pursuing their dreams without the help of others, but some other will help the community to make it safe and better.To teach them what they are capable of,to beleive in themselfs that they can do as the things wealthy people does.	i believe they are diffenrent ways of feeling happy and proud of what you do, i feel happy helping others that doesnt means i help every person in front of me, i try to do what i think is best and good to make somebody happy.
arg33122_arg33103	o7_4	I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.

I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.	Well me personally I think advancement of the common good is better. I don't really know how to back this up, I just know its the way i feel about the topic. I guess because I'm not a selfish person at all when it comes to anything. I believe in sharing and helping others out. So if there's something i have to sacrifice personally for the advance of the common good, 9 times out of 10 I'm going to do it.

arg33099_arg33082	o8_1	Both endeavors are better to be part of.But I as an individual I would like to advance the common good in this society to become unpetty with each other,to do things way better than they use to.Everyone in this world knows what they want to be. To be alone pursuing their dreams without the help of others, but some other will help the community to make it safe and better.To teach them what they are capable of,to beleive in themselfs that they can do as the things wealthy people does.	advancing the common good is better to me because, If i were to pursue my own personal pursuit, it wouldn't be all that good, because most of them would be selfish choices that woulld end up hurting someone else, i dont like hurting people.

arg33129_arg33114	o8_5,o7_4	I volunteer at Irving Cares, and when I do I feel so great that I can help the community. To me when I help advance the common good I am helping myself. When people do something for the good of others it helps them out in the long run. Whether it is a favor in return or anything else. In a personal pursuit you are just helping yourself. If we all just helped ourselves where would our world be? We all depend on others for help at some point. This world should be about others, not just me.	i believe they are diffenrent ways of feeling happy and proud of what you do, i feel happy helping others that doesnt means i help every person in front of me, i try to do what i think is best and good to make somebody happy.
arg33139_arg33122	o9_1	I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.	There once was a rapper who said he was the people's Champ. When wanting to be successful sometimes you need to worry about the common good because that's what people want. I believe that advancing the common good is a better endeavor. Because when always thinking about your self and your personal pursuits you tend to become conceited and become an A hole. And an A jerk is a person that's not liked and when alone and not liked by others becomes lonely.
arg33135_arg33155	o8_1	I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.	Advancing the Common good is a better endeavor than a personal pursuit. For example there are those who want to help others. A personal pursuit however is only for those selfish people who only care about themselves. The common good happens to some from a loan for college, to a charity for an orphanage, a school, etc

arg33136_arg33090	o7_4	I think advancing the common good would be better in the long run. I mean sure you can worry about yourself, but put it like this, "Your not the most important person in the world". If everyone just thought about just them and not about other people where would we be. Its better to put others first and think about yourself later then to put yourself first.

So when helping out others, you make others feel good as well as yourself.	Well personally I think that personal pursuit is better. No reason really, I just feel that I can help the people I care about most if im looking out for myself instead of the whole world. If i focus on my goals then someday I may be able to give my family what they have always dreamed about in return helping me even more.

Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor."

I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.	Well, I take the perspective of my parents, because of the way they try to make me, my brother, the rest of the family and friends happy. they would spend all of there money and time on others than themselves.
arg33178_arg33110	o7_1	Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.	I strongly believe that helping yourself is not a selfish thing to do. If everyone took care of themselves and tried to make themselves better people then there would be no use of common good. You are the only person that knows what you feel, think and believe if you want change you would do change to yourself.
arg33129_arg33119	o8_1	I volunteer at Irving Cares, and when I do I feel so great that I can help the community. To me when I help advance the common good I am helping myself. When people do something for the good of others it helps them out in the long run. Whether it is a favor in return or anything else. In a personal pursuit you are just helping yourself. If we all just helped ourselves where would our world be? We all depend on others for help at some point. This world should be about others, not just me.

arg33100_arg33136	o6_2	I think advancing the common good would be better in the long run. I mean sure you can worry about yourself, but put it like this, "Your not the most important person in the world". If everyone just thought about just them and not about other people where would we be. Its better to put others first and think about yourself later then to put yourself first.	Well personally I think that personal pursuit is better. No reason really, I just feel that I can help the people I care about most if im looking out for myself instead of the whole world. If i focus on my goals then someday I may be able to give my family what they have always dreamed about in return helping me even more.
arg33100_arg33156	o9_4	Everybody has goals and things that they want to accomplish in life. However, a person that helps the community and puts other people in front of themselves will most surely live a better life. If you really think about it, advancing the common good is basically a win-win situation. You get the support of other people, and you can also get recognition for yourself as a reward for your help.	Well personally I think that personal pursuit is better. No reason really, I just feel that I can help the people I care about most if im looking out for myself instead of the whole world.

arg33134_arg33160	o7_1	Usually my decision in the end is yes and no,or goes both ways. Today, however it is advancing for the common good. Making a decision to better suit yourself will help you for that moment, but in the long run who will it really help? Whereas, if you make an advancement for the common good you help yourself and other people. If you think about it we all want the world to be a "better place", and if you've noticed personal endeavors have gotten "us" into some not so happy predicaments.	Well me personally I think advancement of the common good is better. I don't really know how to back this up, I just know its the way i feel about the topic. I guess because I'm not a selfish person at all when it comes to anything. I believe in sharing and helping others out. So if there's something i have to sacrifice personally for the advance of the common good, 9 times out of 10 I'm going to do it.
arg33160_arg33084	o8_4,o7_4	Whether you are in a venture purely for yourself or others, you still end up affecting the people around you. <br/> When asking someone why they decide to help with the common good, the response would be something along the lines of, "it feels good to help out." <br/> Ultimately, people don't help out people unless they get some sort of satisfaction out of it, be it whether they community service hours, material rewards, fame, or just having the satisfaction of knowing that you have importance. So when helping out others, you make others feel good as well as yourself.	Well me personally I think advancement of the common good is better.

arg33155_arg33103	o9_1,o5_2,o5_3,o7_1	Advancing the Common good is a better endeavor than a personal pursuit. For example there are those who want to help others. A personal pursuit however is only for those selfish people who only care about themselves. The common good happens to some from a loan for college, to a charity for an orphanage, a school, etc	I say the common good because of the type of forces that you can make as a whole group. like that person that says that by not voting they are not making a difference and when you look at the whole the population or percentage is bigger than of those who did vote. So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.

I think the common good is a better endeavor, because it's better to give then to receive. It's better to give other people you're hand out in help then you holding your own hand.
arg33160_arg33049	o7_4	Advancing the common good is always better than personal pursuit. If every person decided to advance the common good, then every person would see the effects of it.

In my opinion, i think that advancing the common good is better because when helping others, not only is it appreciated by that person or people, but it makes you feel better as well. It doesn't mean that I won't spend time on myself, but if I have the opportunity to help others, I'll do my best to accomplish that.

arg33060_arg33082	o8_1,o9_1,o5_2,o7_4	I think that advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit. The reason for this is that it is better to help others than just to think about yourself. We need to improve our community first before we think about ourselves. If everyone tried to take care of their community then there would be no dangerous places.	Both endeavors are better to be part of.But I as an individual I would like to advance the common good in this society to become unpetty with each other,to do things way better than they use to.Everyone in this world knows what they want to be.

arg33135_arg33141	o5_1,o6_1	I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.	I believe its best advancing towards the common good, but it doesn't really exist in this world.

Simply Written <br/> Seeking to advance the Common good <br/> allows doors to be opened and barriers to be <br/> broken, and after a journey (or) series of <br/> considerate acts one can have an less-difficult <br/> time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle. <br/> The word for this debate is <br/> [sacrifice] <br/> How much would a person really "sacrifice" <br/> for his or her neighbor without being <br/> blinded by the light beemed from selfishness?? <br/> No matter where a person is in thier life.... <br/> Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did <br/> (or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!
arg33114_arg33178	o7_4	Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.	i believe they are diffenrent ways of feeling happy and proud of what you do, i feel happy helping others that doesnt means i help every person in front of me, i try to do what i think is best and good to make somebody happy.
arg33135_arg33139	o8_1,o9_1	I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.	There once was a rapper who said he was the people's Champ. When wanting to be successful sometimes you need to worry about the common good because that's what people want. I believe that advancing the common good is a better endeavor. Because when always thinking about your self and your personal pursuits you tend to become conceited and become an A hole. And an A jerk is a person that's not liked and when alone and not liked by others becomes lonely.
arg33139_arg33134	o5_3,o7_1	Usually my decision in the end is yes and no,or goes both ways. Today, however it is advancing for the common good. Making a decision to better suit yourself will help you for that moment, but in the long run who will it really help? Whereas, if you make an advancement for the common good you help yourself and other people. If you think about it we all want the world to be a "better place", and if you've noticed personal endeavors have gotten "us" into some not so happy predicaments.

If i focus on my goals then someday I may be able to give my family what they have always dreamed about in return helping me even more.
arg33119_arg33160	o8_1,o6_2	I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.	Well me personally I think advancement of the common good is better. I don't really know how to back this up, I just know its the way i feel about the topic. I guess because I'm not a selfish person at all when it comes to anything. I believe in sharing and helping others out. So if there's something i have to sacrifice personally for the advance of the common good, 9 times out of 10 I'm going to do it.

arg33156_arg33141	o8_1	Everybody has goals and things that they want to accomplish in life. However, a person that helps the community and puts other people in front of themselves will most surely live a better life.

I believe its best advancing towards the common good, but it doesn't really exist in this world. Mostly everyone is greedy, selfish, only would care about what they want, and not caring about what others would want.

I strongly believe that helping yourself is not a selfish thing to do. If everyone took care of themselves and tried to make themselves better people then there would be no use of common good.

arg33113_arg33060	o6_1	I think that advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit. The reason for this is that it is better to help others than just to think about yourself.

Benefiting yourself is always an assessable task but having a chance to better the common good only comes around once in a life time.

If i focus on my goals then someday I may be able to give my family what they have always dreamed about in return helping me even more.
arg33176_arg33119	o8_1,o6_1	I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.	Advancing the common good is much better. From the very first day our parents or our teachers have taught us about team work. <br/> The whole point of doing community service is about the common good. We have to help others in order to help our selves.

When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.	advancing the common good is better to me because, If i were to pursue my own personal pursuit, it wouldn't be all that good, because most of them would be selfish choices that woulld end up hurting someone else, i dont like hurting people. It would be a much better world if we thought about everyone else well being before we think about our selves.

We have to help others in order to help our selves.	I think advancing the common good would be better in the long run. I mean sure you can worry about yourself, but put it like this, "Your not the most important person in the world". If everyone just thought about just them and not about other people where would we be. Its better to put others first and think about yourself later then to put yourself first.
arg33092_arg33113	o8_1	Benefiting yourself is always an assessable task but having a chance to better the common good only comes around once in a life time. You have to take into consideration that you can improve the lives or situations of the masses or just yourself. I believe that by advancing the common good you spread the wealth of nobility to others as well as yourself and that is the greatest benefit of all.	I think the common good is a better endeavor, because it's better to give then to receive. It's better to give other people you're hand out in help then you holding your own hand.
arg33134_arg33178	o7_4	Usually my decision in the end is yes and no,or goes both ways. Today, however it is advancing for the common good. Making a decision to better suit yourself will help you for that moment, but in the long run who will it really help? Whereas, if you make an advancement for the common good you help yourself and other people. If you think about it we all want the world to be a "better place", and if you've noticed personal endeavors have gotten "us" into some not so happy predicaments.	Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.
arg33155_arg33177	o8_1	Advancing the Common good is a better endeavor than a personal pursuit. For example there are those who want to help others.

arg33114_arg33103	o7_1	I say the common good because of the type of forces that you can make as a whole group. like that person that says that by not voting they are not making a difference and when you look at the whole the population or percentage is bigger than of those who did vote. So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.	i believe they are diffenrent ways of feeling happy and proud of what you do, i feel happy helping others that doesnt means i help every person in front of me, i try to do what i think is best and good to make somebody happy.

arg33084_arg33139	o8_1	Whether you are in a venture purely for yourself or others, you still end up affecting the people around you. <br/> When asking someone why they decide to help with the common good, the response would be something along the lines of, "it feels good to help out." <br/> Ultimately, people don't help out people unless they get some sort of satisfaction out of it, be it whether they community service hours, material rewards, fame, or just having the satisfaction of knowing that you have importance. So when helping out others, you make others feel good as well as yourself.	There once was a rapper who said he was the people's Champ. When wanting to be successful sometimes you need to worry about the common good because that's what people want. I believe that advancing the common good is a better endeavor. Because when always thinking about your self and your personal pursuits you tend to become conceited and become an A hole. And an A jerk is a person that's not liked and when alone and not liked by others becomes lonely.
arg33160_arg33147	o8_1,o7_1,o7_4	In my opinion, i think that advancing the common good is better because when helping others, not only is it appreciated by that person or people, but it makes you feel better as well.

Well me personally I think advancement of the common good is better. I don't really know how to back this up, I just know its the way i feel about the topic. I guess because I'm not a selfish person at all when it comes to anything. I believe in sharing and helping others out. So if there's something i have to sacrifice personally for the advance of the common good, 9 times out of 10 I'm going to do it.

arg33060_arg33089	o7_4	I think that advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit. The reason for this is that it is better to help others than just to think about yourself.

The ability to do both would be awesome, but since I have to choose I'd rather help others in any way I can.

So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.

If you think about it we all want the world to be a "better place", and if you've noticed personal endeavors have gotten "us" into some not so happy predicaments.	I think that advancing the common good is better because its helping out the community.

I strongly believe that helping yourself is not a selfish thing to do. If everyone took care of themselves and tried to make themselves better people then there would be no use of common good.

I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.	advancing the common good is better to me because, If i were to pursue my own personal pursuit, it wouldn't be all that good, because most of them would be selfish choices that woulld end up hurting someone else, i dont like hurting people. It would be a much better world if we thought about everyone else well being before we think about our selves.
arg33049_arg33147	o8_1	Advancing the common good is always better than personal pursuit. If every person decided to advance the common good, then every person would see the effects of it. Of course, most people chose personal pursuit because they will benefit from it.	In my opinion, i think that advancing the common good is better because when helping others, not only is it appreciated by that person or people, but it makes you feel better as well. It doesn't mean that I won't spend time on myself, but if I have the opportunity to help others, I'll do my best to accomplish that.

Well I'm kind of in the middle because i always think that helping people is a good thing and a way that you can get your blessings. But also sometime you have too help yourself be successful and make sure you can survive and provide. So to a certain extent it is good to help others but then its all about you.

arg33100_arg33177	o7_1	Well personally I think that personal pursuit is better. No reason really, I just feel that I can help the people I care about most if im looking out for myself instead of the whole world. If i focus on my goals then someday I may be able to give my family what they have always dreamed about in return helping me even more.	Well, I take the perspective of my parents, because of the way they try to make me, my brother, the rest of the family and friends happy. they would spend all of there money and time on others than themselves.
arg33141_arg33114	o9_2	i believe they are diffenrent ways of feeling happy and proud of what you do, i feel happy helping others that doesnt means i help every person in front of me, i try to do what i think is best and good to make somebody happy.	I believe its best advancing towards the common good, but it doesn't really exist in this world. Mostly everyone is greedy, selfish, only would care about what they want, and not caring about what others would want. I believe everyone have small feeling towards the common good, but most people think they are important than anyone else in the whole world.

I strongly believe that helping yourself is not a selfish thing to do. If everyone took care of themselves and tried to make themselves better people then there would be no use of common good. You are the only person that knows what you feel, think and believe if you want change you would do change to yourself.
arg33162_arg33060	o8_1	I think that advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit. The reason for this is that it is better to help others than just to think about yourself. We need to improve our community first before we think about ourselves. If everyone tried to take care of their community then there would be no dangerous places.	This is planet Earth, shared by billions, not just you. If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.
arg33155_arg33129	o8_1,o8_4	I volunteer at Irving Cares, and when I do I feel so great that I can help the community. To me when I help advance the common good I am helping myself. When people do something for the good of others it helps them out in the long run. Whether it is a favor in return or anything else. In a personal pursuit you are just helping yourself. If we all just helped ourselves where would our world be? We all depend on others for help at some point. This world should be about others, not just me.	Advancing the Common good is a better endeavor than a personal pursuit. For example there are those who want to help others. A personal pursuit however is only for those selfish people who only care about themselves. The common good happens to some from a loan for college, to a charity for an orphanage, a school, etc
arg33075_arg33089	o8_1,o8_5	While striving to make advancements for the common good you can change the world forever. <br/> Allot of people have succeded in doing so. Our founding fathers, Thomas Edison, George Washington, Martin Luther King jr, and many more. These people made huge advances for the common good and they are honored for it.	The ability to do both would be awesome, but since I have to choose I'd rather help others in any way I can. Even a little thing can impact someone's life, like being a friend or helping them with getting their needs to survive life.
arg33147_arg33134	o6_1	Usually my decision in the end is yes and no,or goes both ways. Today, however it is advancing for the common good. Making a decision to better suit yourself will help you for that moment, but in the long run who will it really help? Whereas, if you make an advancement for the common good you help yourself and other people. If you think about it we all want the world to be a "better place", and if you've noticed personal endeavors have gotten "us" into some not so happy predicaments.	In my opinion, i think that advancing the common good is better because when helping others, not only is it appreciated by that person or people, but it makes you feel better as well. It doesn't mean that I won't spend time on myself, but if I have the opportunity to help others, I'll do my best to accomplish that.

arg33047_arg33074	o9_1	In a perfect world, everyone would not be selfish and would use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity, but we don't live in a perfect world nor will we ever. I think that everyone has a God-given talent that can be used to better the world. If everyone put a little effort into improving society, our life would run a lot smoother. You can also combine the two if advancing the common good doesnt sound appealing to you. Their are plenty of jobs that do just that.	Simply Written <br/> Seeking to advance the Common good <br/> allows doors to be opened and barriers to be <br/> broken, and after a journey (or) series of <br/> considerate acts one can have an less-difficult <br/> time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle. <br/> The word for this debate is <br/> [sacrifice] <br/> How much would a person really "sacrifice" <br/> for his or her neighbor without being <br/> blinded by the light beemed from selfishness?? <br/> No matter where a person is in thier life.... <br/> Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did <br/> (or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!

I think that advancing the common good is better because its helping out the community. But personal pursuit will be better because i know that if i dont go to college after high school then i wont go at all so i would choose my personal pursuit.
