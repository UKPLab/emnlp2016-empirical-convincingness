arg33253_arg33311	o8_1	I would definately turned them in even if it hurst me. Any person that commits a murder should not get away with it because if they did it once they can do it again so it dangerous to have them out in the enviroment. Also, if i dont turn her in how do i know that later on in life i might be a victim.	Yes I would. Nobody should get away with murder. Not that I would ever marrie sombody that would muder anyone. But that's beside the point.
arg33338_arg33304	o8_1,o9_3	The murders of a person is a crime that cant be overlook, to sleep next to a person who has commited this crime, and you knowing about makes you as much responsible as that persons.	I would turn them in, because that is just crazy. Why would you ever kill somebody? Whoever would do that shall be punished for their crime, I don't care who you are to me, or what you mean to me I would definitely turn you in. If you help that person you may also go to jail for the crime as well, and I'm not going to jail.
arg33261_arg33307	o8_1,o9_3	As an ambitious, young person wanting to become a lawful, successful, homicide detective, I would not be lenient with any murderer in my midst. <br/> Hopefully, the murder wouldn't be the result of a pleasure/malicious-kill, so that the sentencing won't be as harsh, but nonetheless, all murderers must be tried. After all, hopefully my spouse will understand that having to live in hiding is basically the same as being in prison except much worse since there would be little chance for parole since they will have to live with the guilt and/or the fear of being caught for the rest of their lives.	I would turn him in becasue it is wrong for any reason to kill someone. If he can kill one person what says that he will not kill me? Everyone wants to know what happened to their loved ones and that would give them the peace that the person that did it was paying for what he did. Love is not worth the risk of you getting caught for not telling what you know.
arg33272_arg33254	o9_1,o7_4	If my spouse committed murder I would have to turn them in, because I don't think I could go on with life knowing that they've murdered someone. The relationship wouldn't be the same it would change because now you view the person as somebody else, you don't see them as your spouse any more, you just see them as a bad person, and they could be crazy enough to do something to you.	I put my argument on the side saying "yes" but in reality it really depends in my opinion. If my husband killed someone in self-defense, I'd rather them kill the person than my husband die, but if he just killed someone for no reason I probably would turn him in because love may be strong but it can also be blind. I would not want to be married to a murderer because what if one day he decided to kill me?
arg33370_arg33345	o8_1,o7_3	Killing someone is wrong no matter what. If you kill someone then i think you should do the right thing and turn yourself in, instead of waiting and wondering if someone else would turn you in. I know it would be difficult for me to turn in my wife, but they commited a horrible crime and they should pay for it. No one is above the law basicly.	HECK YES, I would turn her in with the QUICKNESS because if she did something like that then she is a little Crazy, loCo,insane in the brain, and Im not Trying to be her next victim. A murder is a murder and its illegal and not right.

I feel that if my spouse killed a person out of self defense or out of defense for another person then no I wouldn't turn them in. Another circumstance would be if they killed a person for killing someone or something like I that, then no I wouldn't turn them in. If they killed cold heartedly like rape, for money, objects and or just a pure disliking or a person then yes I would turn them in because someone that's that cold could kill me.
arg33253_arg33366	o8_1,o9_1	I would turn them in whether it was self-defense or an act of rage.

My conscience would eat at me and I could not live knowing that there's a family that is mourning because of my spouse's actions.	Yes I would. Nobody should get away with murder.

arg33253_arg33339	o8_1	Yes I would be happy and relieved to turn my spouse in for murder. Killing someone is the one number one crime in this world. I don't want to stay married to a crazy woman who commits murder. I wouldn't feel safe if we have children in the house or sleeping next to her. I wouldn't be able to sleep or think right for months, maybe years.	Yes I would. Nobody should get away with murder. Not that I would ever marrie sombody that would muder anyone. But that's beside the point.
arg33230_arg33348	o8_1,o5_2	Yes, I would turn my spouse in. Who is to say that if they killed once that they wont kill again. Who is to say that you aren't there next target. If they were to ever become paranoid about being caught they might just blow out your brains because paranoia makes you do crazy things. It would be hard to turn them in because you have a deep connection with your spouse but it's something you have to do for your own safety.	I say yes i would because no matter what nothing should make you kill any one, How are you going to kill someone and say it was a mistake.thats not right I dont care what nobody say if it was a mistake or what.

Well I understand some people are crazy in love, but for me that would be to crazy. Taking another persons life is never the solution or acceptable.

arg33230_arg33367	o8_1,o9_4	I would say yes to that because my wife would be a murderer. A murderer as a spouse is not the happiest life you can bring upon your self, knowing that everyday you would have so much stress about when the cops might break in and take you for affiliating with a crime scene or even if your own life is in danger.

arg33223_arg33293	o8_1,o8_5,o9_4,o7_1,o7_2,o7_4	I would turn my spouse in if they told me they committed murder. Weather it was by accident or on purpose. If it was an accident than the police will figure that out. For example, what if my spouse murdered your spouse. Wouldn't you want to know who killed him/her? I would, I wouldn't allow my self to rest until I knew. Sometimes in life their is more to worry about than yourself.	i would turn in my wife because its wrong to kill someone. it could have been an accident but it was still wrong and besides the police are going to find out who killed that person but i don't want her to leave me for a long period of time so i would tell but then again i wouldn't.

The murders of a person is a crime that cant be overlook, to sleep next to a person who has commited this crime, and you knowing about makes you as much responsible as that persons.
arg33223_arg33245	o8_1	I would definetly turned her in. No matter what, it is murder. Nobody should commit murder, and plus she might be crazy and kill me, or kill someone else. I would have to live scared in my own house, because of her killing. because if I don't turn her in, someone eventually would find out about it, and I could be arrested too because of not telling. But it would be sad because she's your spouse, and you love her, so I rather preffer her never telling anyone, that makes my life easier.	I would turn my spouse in if they told me they committed murder. Weather it was by accident or on purpose. If it was an accident than the police will figure that out. For example, what if my spouse murdered your spouse. Wouldn't you want to know who killed him/her? I would, I wouldn't allow my self to rest until I knew. Sometimes in life their is more to worry about than yourself.
arg33323_arg33269	o9_2,o6_3	Murder under any circumstance is not right. A person who commits the act knows the consequences, and they know that they are guilty. I wouldn't be able to look at my spouse the same ever again. I would not be able to live with the secret of a murder. <br/> So yea, i would turn them in.	It all depends on the severity of the kill. Ofcourse I would be empathetic towards my husband and want him free, but if I knew it was a malicious deed instead of self defense, or to defend his family or belongings I would probably leave and want nothong to do with it.
arg33221_arg33261	o8_1,o8_4,o8_5,o7_1	As an ambitious, young person wanting to become a lawful, successful, homicide detective, I would not be lenient with any murderer in my midst. <br/> Hopefully, the murder wouldn't be the result of a pleasure/malicious-kill, so that the sentencing won't be as harsh, but nonetheless, all murderers must be tried. After all, hopefully my spouse will understand that having to live in hiding is basically the same as being in prison except much worse since there would be little chance for parole since they will have to live with the guilt and/or the fear of being caught for the rest of their lives.	I would say that most likely I would turn my husband in because a murderer is not who I wanted to marry. And also, if my husband killed someone else, who knows if his next attack will be on me. Obviously he is messed up in the head if he committed murder and thats not who I want to spend the rest of my life with.
arg33367_arg33280	o9_3	I would say yes to that because my wife would be a murderer. A murderer as a spouse is not the happiest life you can bring upon your self, knowing that everyday you would have so much stress about when the cops might break in and take you for affiliating with a crime scene or even if your own life is in danger. So from these reasons I would turn my spouse in.	Yes, if the person I loved and lived with murdered someone then I would definitely turn them in. Murder is premeditated and intentional so you never know if later on down the line they will turn on you.
arg33280_arg33342	o8_1	I would have to say yes. She committed murder, a thing that can get you in major trouble, even if you're an accompalice. I don't care what the reason was, it could have been accidental, there could have been someone trying to attack her, or whatever, she killed someone. The second she tells me, I wil call the police, just in case she either goes on another killing spree or decides to kill me	Yes, if the person I loved and lived with murdered someone then I would definitely turn them in. Murder is premeditated and intentional so you never know if later on down the line they will turn on you.
arg33282_arg33280	o9_1	Yes, if the person I loved and lived with murdered someone then I would definitely turn them in. Murder is premeditated and intentional so you never know if later on down the line they will turn on you.	Yes, because who knows if they will turn on you and than one night that you less expect it they will try to kill you because its on their mind that you know the truth and the truth cant get out and they need to get rid of all types of clues even of those they love just incase they try to talk to someone.
arg33370_arg33307	o8_1,o8_5,o6_2	I would turn him in becasue it is wrong for any reason to kill someone. If he can kill one person what says that he will not kill me? Everyone wants to know what happened to their loved ones and that would give them the peace that the person that did it was paying for what he did. Love is not worth the risk of you getting caught for not telling what you know.	HECK YES, I would turn her in with the QUICKNESS because if she did something like that then she is a little Crazy, loCo,insane in the brain, and Im not Trying to be her next victim. A murder is a murder and its illegal and not right.
arg33230_arg33342	o8_1	I would have to say yes. She committed murder, a thing that can get you in major trouble, even if you're an accompalice. I don't care what the reason was, it could have been accidental, there could have been someone trying to attack her, or whatever, she killed someone. The second she tells me, I wil call the police, just in case she either goes on another killing spree or decides to kill me	I say yes i would because no matter what nothing should make you kill any one, How are you going to kill someone and say it was a mistake.thats not right I dont care what nobody say if it was a mistake or what.
arg33224_arg33272	o8_1	If my spouse committed murder I would have to turn them in, because I don't think I could go on with life knowing that they've murdered someone. The relationship wouldn't be the same it would change because now you view the person as somebody else, you don't see them as your spouse any more, you just see them as a bad person, and they could be crazy enough to do something to you.	I would say yes to some circumstances I would say yes but for others it would be a no I will not turn them in. I feel that if my spouse killed a person out of self defense or out of defense for another person then no I wouldn't turn them in. Another circumstance would be if they killed a person for killing someone or something like I that, then no I wouldn't turn them in. If they killed cold heartedly like rape, for money, objects and or just a pure disliking or a person then yes I would turn them in because someone that's that cold could kill me.
arg33332_arg33261	o8_1	As an ambitious, young person wanting to become a lawful, successful, homicide detective, I would not be lenient with any murderer in my midst. <br/> Hopefully, the murder wouldn't be the result of a pleasure/malicious-kill, so that the sentencing won't be as harsh, but nonetheless, all murderers must be tried.

I would turn my husband in because that's just plain wrong. I would explain "How would you feel if somebody killed a family member or a close friend? Would you want them to be punished?" So for doing a wrong and to become better you have to take your consequence's.
arg33372_arg33254	o8_4	I put my argument on the side saying "yes" but in reality it really depends in my opinion. If my husband killed someone in self-defense, I'd rather them kill the person than my husband die, but if he just killed someone for no reason I probably would turn him in because love may be strong but it can also be blind. I would not want to be married to a murderer because what if one day he decided to kill me?	I would say that i would turn them in because i don't think that's right, killing someone and getting away with it, and also i wouldn't want to be next to a murderer on my bed.
arg33366_arg33370	o8_1	I would turn them in whether it was self-defense or an act of rage. If it was self-defense they would most likely get away with it but if it were an act of rage I would not want to spend the rest of my life with that person. My conscience would eat at me and I could not live knowing that there's a family that is mourning because of my spouse's actions.	HECK YES, I would turn her in with the QUICKNESS because if she did something like that then she is a little Crazy, loCo,insane in the brain, and Im not Trying to be her next victim. A murder is a murder and its illegal and not right.

My conscience would eat at me and I could not live knowing that there's a family that is mourning because of my spouse's actions.	I say yes i would because no matter what nothing should make you kill any one, How are you going to kill someone and say it was a mistake.thats not right I dont care what nobody say if it was a mistake or what.

A murder is a murder and its illegal and not right.
arg33303_arg33348	o9_3,o9_4,o6_1,o7_2	Yes, I would turn my spouse in. Who is to say that if they killed once that they wont kill again. Who is to say that you aren't there next target. If they were to ever become paranoid about being caught they might just blow out your brains because paranoia makes you do crazy things. It would be hard to turn them in because you have a deep connection with your spouse but it's something you have to do for your own safety.	Even though people make mistakes, a murder is always commited with the best of intentions to kill. It can't possibly be a mistake if I stab some one in the leg with a sharp object, and say that it wasn't my intention to make him bleed. <br/> My point is that I wouldn't want to live under the same roof with a woman that could possibly be schizophrenic.
arg33318_arg33332	o9_3	I would turn my husband in because that's just plain wrong. I would explain "How would you feel if somebody killed a family member or a close friend? Would you want them to be punished?" So for doing a wrong and to become better you have to take your consequence's.	Im all about the no snitching saying but when it comes to murder thats when the line is drawn. Yea at first I probably wouldn't do anything about it. Then I think about there is few reasons why someone would be drove to kill but I don't think the act should be committed. In saying that i would turn my wife in if she ever killed somebody.
arg33311_arg33289	o8_1,o9_1	Yes definately i will turn him in to the police because he has commited a murder and its a sin. Maybe if he gets arrested,he can feel guilty for what he has done and try not to repeat it again. And also how can i trust a murderer?He can even be telling a lie to me and maybe can kill me for someone else in the future.so Just by confiding to me does not make him clean and innocent.	I would definately turned them in even if it hurst me. Any person that commits a murder should not get away with it because if they did it once they can do it again so it dangerous to have them out in the enviroment. Also, if i dont turn her in how do i know that later on in life i might be a victim.

If you kill someone then i think you should do the right thing and turn yourself in, instead of waiting and wondering if someone else would turn you in.

No one is above the law basicly.	i would turn in my wife because its wrong to kill someone. it could have been an accident but it was still wrong and besides the police are going to find out who killed that person but i don't want her to leave me for a long period of time so i would tell but then again i wouldn't.
arg33372_arg33349	o8_1,o6_1	I would turn my spouse in if they committed murder. I would not want my wife to turn on me and kill me. If I found out that she had killed someone I would be gone. You can't love a person if they are not the person that you fell in love with. And I wouldn't fall in love with a murderer.

And also how can i trust a murderer?He can even be telling a lie to me and maybe can kill me for someone else in the future.so Just by confiding to me does not make him clean and innocent.	Even though people make mistakes, a murder is always commited with the best of intentions to kill. It can't possibly be a mistake if I stab some one in the leg with a sharp object, and say that it wasn't my intention to make him bleed. <br/> My point is that I wouldn't want to live under the same roof with a woman that could possibly be schizophrenic.
arg33312_arg33254	o8_1,o8_4	I put my argument on the side saying "yes" but in reality it really depends in my opinion. If my husband killed someone in self-defense, I'd rather them kill the person than my husband die, but if he just killed someone for no reason I probably would turn him in because love may be strong but it can also be blind. I would not want to be married to a murderer because what if one day he decided to kill me?	Well I understand some people are crazy in love, but for me that would be to crazy. Taking another persons life is never the solution or acceptable. Who knows if her next move is not towards me, who knows? If she was crazy enough to do it once, she is crazy enough to do it again.

The murders of a person is a crime that cant be overlook, to sleep next to a person who has commited this crime, and you knowing about makes you as much responsible as that persons.
arg33318_arg33272	o9_1	If my spouse committed murder I would have to turn them in, because I don't think I could go on with life knowing that they've murdered someone. The relationship wouldn't be the same it would change because now you view the person as somebody else, you don't see them as your spouse any more, you just see them as a bad person, and they could be crazy enough to do something to you.	Im all about the no snitching saying but when it comes to murder thats when the line is drawn. Yea at first I probably wouldn't do anything about it. Then I think about there is few reasons why someone would be drove to kill but I don't think the act should be committed. In saying that i would turn my wife in if she ever killed somebody.

arg33370_arg33223	o8_1,o5_2,o7_1	I would turn my spouse in if they told me they committed murder. Weather it was by accident or on purpose. If it was an accident than the police will figure that out. For example, what if my spouse murdered your spouse. Wouldn't you want to know who killed him/her? I would, I wouldn't allow my self to rest until I knew. Sometimes in life their is more to worry about than yourself.	HECK YES, I would turn her in with the QUICKNESS because if she did something like that then she is a little Crazy, loCo,insane in the brain, and Im not Trying to be her next victim.

And also how can i trust a murderer?He can even be telling a lie to me and maybe can kill me for someone else in the future.so Just by confiding to me does not make him clean and innocent.	I would turn my husband in because that's just plain wrong. I would explain "How would you feel if somebody killed a family member or a close friend? Would you want them to be punished?" So for doing a wrong and to become better you have to take your consequence's.
arg33372_arg33367	o8_1	I would say yes to that because my wife would be a murderer. A murderer as a spouse is not the happiest life you can bring upon your self, knowing that everyday you would have so much stress about when the cops might break in and take you for affiliating with a crime scene or even if your own life is in danger. So from these reasons I would turn my spouse in.

arg33271_arg33280	o9_1	Yes, if the person I loved and lived with murdered someone then I would definitely turn them in. Murder is premeditated and intentional so you never know if later on down the line they will turn on you.	After watching many episodes of COPS and Cold Case Files; the individual that is always involved with the murderer and or is an acomplice is always caught. I dont want to be the acomplice and be caught. Plus, if my spouse killed someone, she would be too crazy for me so therefore I would break up with her.

arg33370_arg33348	o8_1,o5_1,o5_2	Yes, I would turn my spouse in. Who is to say that if they killed once that they wont kill again. Who is to say that you aren't there next target. If they were to ever become paranoid about being caught they might just blow out your brains because paranoia makes you do crazy things. It would be hard to turn them in because you have a deep connection with your spouse but it's something you have to do for your own safety.

But if he killed a person that I knew and that was harming us then I would think about it. It's most likely that I would turn him in just because I would be afraid to leave with a person like that, and also what if he thinks I will say something and kills me too.	I would say that i would turn them in because i don't think that's right, killing someone and getting away with it, and also i wouldn't want to be next to a murderer on my bed.
arg33318_arg33223	o9_3	I would turn my spouse in if they told me they committed murder. Weather it was by accident or on purpose. If it was an accident than the police will figure that out.

Sometimes in life their is more to worry about than yourself.	Im all about the no snitching saying but when it comes to murder thats when the line is drawn. Yea at first I probably wouldn't do anything about it. Then I think about there is few reasons why someone would be drove to kill but I don't think the act should be committed. In saying that i would turn my wife in if she ever killed somebody.
arg33366_arg33282	o8_5	I would turn them in whether it was self-defense or an act of rage. If it was self-defense they would most likely get away with it but if it were an act of rage I would not want to spend the rest of my life with that person. My conscience would eat at me and I could not live knowing that there's a family that is mourning because of my spouse's actions.	Yes, because who knows if they will turn on you and than one night that you less expect it they will try to kill you because its on their mind that you know the truth and the truth cant get out and they need to get rid of all types of clues even of those they love just incase they try to talk to someone.

arg33254_arg33344	o8_4	I put my argument on the side saying "yes" but in reality it really depends in my opinion.

I would not want to be married to a murderer because what if one day he decided to kill me?

And he will have to pay for the consequences of committing a crime.
arg33348_arg33304	o8_1	Yes, I would turn my spouse in. Who is to say that if they killed once that they wont kill again. Who is to say that you aren't there next target. If they were to ever become paranoid about being caught they might just blow out your brains because paranoia makes you do crazy things. It would be hard to turn them in because you have a deep connection with your spouse but it's something you have to do for your own safety.	The murders of a person is a crime that cant be overlook, to sleep next to a person who has commited this crime, and you knowing about makes you as much responsible as that persons.

arg33261_arg33230	o8_1,o8_4	As an ambitious, young person wanting to become a lawful, successful, homicide detective, I would not be lenient with any murderer in my midst. <br/> Hopefully, the murder wouldn't be the result of a pleasure/malicious-kill, so that the sentencing won't be as harsh, but nonetheless, all murderers must be tried. After all, hopefully my spouse will understand that having to live in hiding is basically the same as being in prison except much worse since there would be little chance for parole since they will have to live with the guilt and/or the fear of being caught for the rest of their lives.

arg33271_arg33367	o9_1,o5_3	I would say yes to that because my wife would be a murderer. A murderer as a spouse is not the happiest life you can bring upon your self, knowing that everyday you would have so much stress about when the cops might break in and take you for affiliating with a crime scene or even if your own life is in danger.

If it was self-defense they would most likely get away with it but if it were an act of rage I would not want to spend the rest of my life with that person. My conscience would eat at me and I could not live knowing that there's a family that is mourning because of my spouse's actions.	I put my argument on the side saying "yes" but in reality it really depends in my opinion. If my husband killed someone in self-defense, I'd rather them kill the person than my husband die, but if he just killed someone for no reason I probably would turn him in because love may be strong but it can also be blind. I would not want to be married to a murderer because what if one day he decided to kill me?
arg33339_arg33280	o8_1	Yes I would be happy and relieved to turn my spouse in for murder. Killing someone is the one number one crime in this world. I don't want to stay married to a crazy woman who commits murder. I wouldn't feel safe if we have children in the house or sleeping next to her. I wouldn't be able to sleep or think right for months, maybe years.	Yes, if the person I loved and lived with murdered someone then I would definitely turn them in. Murder is premeditated and intentional so you never know if later on down the line they will turn on you.
arg33271_arg33344	o8_1	After watching many episodes of COPS and Cold Case Files; the individual that is always involved with the murderer and or is an acomplice is always caught. I dont want to be the acomplice and be caught. Plus, if my spouse killed someone, she would be too crazy for me so therefore I would break up with her.	If my husband murder someone I will turn him in , because is a crime and for every act, I have learn that there is a consequence for everything. And he will have to pay for the consequences of committing a crime.
arg33224_arg33338	o8_4	I would say yes to some circumstances I would say yes but for others it would be a no I will not turn them in. I feel that if my spouse killed a person out of self defense or out of defense for another person then no I wouldn't turn them in. Another circumstance would be if they killed a person for killing someone or something like I that, then no I wouldn't turn them in. If they killed cold heartedly like rape, for money, objects and or just a pure disliking or a person then yes I would turn them in because someone that's that cold could kill me.	I would turn them in, because that is just crazy. Why would you ever kill somebody? Whoever would do that shall be punished for their crime, I don't care who you are to me, or what you mean to me I would definitely turn you in. If you help that person you may also go to jail for the crime as well, and I'm not going to jail.
arg33261_arg33254	o8_1,o8_5	As an ambitious, young person wanting to become a lawful, successful, homicide detective, I would not be lenient with any murderer in my midst. <br/> Hopefully, the murder wouldn't be the result of a pleasure/malicious-kill, so that the sentencing won't be as harsh, but nonetheless, all murderers must be tried. After all, hopefully my spouse will understand that having to live in hiding is basically the same as being in prison except much worse since there would be little chance for parole since they will have to live with the guilt and/or the fear of being caught for the rest of their lives.

arg33304_arg33323	o8_1	Murder under any circumstance is not right. A person who commits the act knows the consequences, and they know that they are guilty.

HECK YES, I would turn her in with the QUICKNESS because if she did something like that then she is a little Crazy, loCo,insane in the brain, and Im not Trying to be her next victim. A murder is a murder and its illegal and not right.
arg33303_arg33245	o8_1,o6_3	I would definetly turned her in. No matter what, it is murder. Nobody should commit murder, and plus she might be crazy and kill me, or kill someone else. I would have to live scared in my own house, because of her killing. because if I don't turn her in, someone eventually would find out about it, and I could be arrested too because of not telling. But it would be sad because she's your spouse, and you love her, so I rather preffer her never telling anyone, that makes my life easier.	Even though people make mistakes, a murder is always commited with the best of intentions to kill. It can't possibly be a mistake if I stab some one in the leg with a sharp object, and say that it wasn't my intention to make him bleed. <br/> My point is that I wouldn't want to live under the same roof with a woman that could possibly be schizophrenic.
arg33349_arg33348	o8_4	Yes, I would turn my spouse in. Who is to say that if they killed once that they wont kill again. Who is to say that you aren't there next target. If they were to ever become paranoid about being caught they might just blow out your brains because paranoia makes you do crazy things. It would be hard to turn them in because you have a deep connection with your spouse but it's something you have to do for your own safety.	I would turn my spouse in if they committed murder. I would not want my wife to turn on me and kill me. If I found out that she had killed someone I would be gone. You can't love a person if they are not the person that you fell in love with. And I wouldn't fall in love with a murderer.

Yes, because who knows if they will turn on you and than one night that you less expect it they will try to kill you because its on their mind that you know the truth and the truth cant get out and they need to get rid of all types of clues even of those they love just incase they try to talk to someone.
arg33311_arg33372	o8_1	I would definately turned them in even if it hurst me. Any person that commits a murder should not get away with it because if they did it once they can do it again so it dangerous to have them out in the enviroment. Also, if i dont turn her in how do i know that later on in life i might be a victim.	I would say that i would turn them in because i don't think that's right, killing someone and getting away with it, and also i wouldn't want to be next to a murderer on my bed.

arg33221_arg33293	o9_2	I would say that most likely I would turn my husband in because a murderer is not who I wanted to marry.

arg33307_arg33253	o8_4	I would turn him in becasue it is wrong for any reason to kill someone. If he can kill one person what says that he will not kill me? Everyone wants to know what happened to their loved ones and that would give them the peace that the person that did it was paying for what he did. Love is not worth the risk of you getting caught for not telling what you know.	Yes I would. Nobody should get away with murder. Not that I would ever marrie sombody that would muder anyone.

Then I think about there is few reasons why someone would be drove to kill but I don't think the act should be committed. In saying that i would turn my wife in if she ever killed somebody.
arg33345_arg33254	o7_4	Killing someone is wrong no matter what. If you kill someone then i think you should do the right thing and turn yourself in, instead of waiting and wondering if someone else would turn you in. I know it would be difficult for me to turn in my wife, but they commited a horrible crime and they should pay for it. No one is above the law basicly.	I put my argument on the side saying "yes" but in reality it really depends in my opinion. If my husband killed someone in self-defense, I'd rather them kill the person than my husband die, but if he just killed someone for no reason I probably would turn him in because love may be strong but it can also be blind. I would not want to be married to a murderer because what if one day he decided to kill me?
arg33223_arg33280	o8_1	I would turn my spouse in if they told me they committed murder. Weather it was by accident or on purpose. If it was an accident than the police will figure that out. For example, what if my spouse murdered your spouse. Wouldn't you want to know who killed him/her? I would, I wouldn't allow my self to rest until I knew. Sometimes in life their is more to worry about than yourself.	Yes, if the person I loved and lived with murdered someone then I would definitely turn them in. Murder is premeditated and intentional so you never know if later on down the line they will turn on you.
arg33221_arg33307	o9_1,o9_4	I would turn him in becasue it is wrong for any reason to kill someone. If he can kill one person what says that he will not kill me? Everyone wants to know what happened to their loved ones and that would give them the peace that the person that did it was paying for what he did. Love is not worth the risk of you getting caught for not telling what you know.	I would say that most likely I would turn my husband in because a murderer is not who I wanted to marry. And also, if my husband killed someone else, who knows if his next attack will be on me. Obviously he is messed up in the head if he committed murder and thats not who I want to spend the rest of my life with.
arg33339_arg33254	o6_1	I put my argument on the side saying "yes" but in reality it really depends in my opinion.

I would not want to be married to a murderer because what if one day he decided to kill me?	Yes I would be happy and relieved to turn my spouse in for murder. Killing someone is the one number one crime in this world. I don't want to stay married to a crazy woman who commits murder. I wouldn't feel safe if we have children in the house or sleeping next to her. I wouldn't be able to sleep or think right for months, maybe years.
arg33289_arg33366	o8_1,o6_3	I would turn them in whether it was self-defense or an act of rage. If it was self-defense they would most likely get away with it but if it were an act of rage I would not want to spend the rest of my life with that person. My conscience would eat at me and I could not live knowing that there's a family that is mourning because of my spouse's actions.	Yes definately i will turn him in to the police because he has commited a murder and its a sin. Maybe if he gets arrested,he can feel guilty for what he has done and try not to repeat it again. And also how can i trust a murderer?He can even be telling a lie to me and maybe can kill me for someone else in the future.so Just by confiding to me does not make him clean and innocent.
arg33289_arg33349	o8_1,o9_1,o6_1	Yes definately i will turn him in to the police because he has commited a murder and its a sin.

I would turn my spouse in if they committed murder. I would not want my wife to turn on me and kill me. If I found out that she had killed someone I would be gone. You can't love a person if they are not the person that you fell in love with. And I wouldn't fall in love with a murderer.
arg33224_arg33293	o8_1	I would say yes to some circumstances I would say yes but for others it would be a no I will not turn them in. I feel that if my spouse killed a person out of self defense or out of defense for another person then no I wouldn't turn them in. Another circumstance would be if they killed a person for killing someone or something like I that, then no I wouldn't turn them in. If they killed cold heartedly like rape, for money, objects and or just a pure disliking or a person then yes I would turn them in because someone that's that cold could kill me.	i would turn in my wife because its wrong to kill someone. it could have been an accident but it was still wrong and besides the police are going to find out who killed that person but i don't want her to leave me for a long period of time so i would tell but then again i wouldn't.
arg33282_arg33318	o8_1	Yes, because who knows if they will turn on you and than one night that you less expect it they will try to kill you because its on their mind that you know the truth and the truth cant get out and they need to get rid of all types of clues even of those they love just incase they try to talk to someone.	Im all about the no snitching saying but when it comes to murder thats when the line is drawn. Yea at first I probably wouldn't do anything about it. Then I think about there is few reasons why someone would be drove to kill but I don't think the act should be committed. In saying that i would turn my wife in if she ever killed somebody.
arg33271_arg33348	o9_4	Yes, I would turn my spouse in. Who is to say that if they killed once that they wont kill again. Who is to say that you aren't there next target. If they were to ever become paranoid about being caught they might just blow out your brains because paranoia makes you do crazy things. It would be hard to turn them in because you have a deep connection with your spouse but it's something you have to do for your own safety.	After watching many episodes of COPS and Cold Case Files; the individual that is always involved with the murderer and or is an acomplice is always caught. I dont want to be the acomplice and be caught. Plus, if my spouse killed someone, she would be too crazy for me so therefore I would break up with her.

arg33245_arg33349	o8_1	I would definetly turned her in. No matter what, it is murder. Nobody should commit murder, and plus she might be crazy and kill me, or kill someone else. I would have to live scared in my own house, because of her killing. because if I don't turn her in, someone eventually would find out about it, and I could be arrested too because of not telling. But it would be sad because she's your spouse, and you love her, so I rather preffer her never telling anyone, that makes my life easier.	I would turn my spouse in if they committed murder. I would not want my wife to turn on me and kill me. If I found out that she had killed someone I would be gone. You can't love a person if they are not the person that you fell in love with.

A person who commits the act knows the consequences, and they know that they are guilty. I wouldn't be able to look at my spouse the same ever again. I would not be able to live with the secret of a murder. <br/> So yea, i would turn them in.

I would turn them in, because that is just crazy. Why would you ever kill somebody? Whoever would do that shall be punished for their crime, I don't care who you are to me, or what you mean to me I would definitely turn you in. If you help that person you may also go to jail for the crime as well, and I'm not going to jail.

I would turn my husband in because that's just plain wrong. I would explain "How would you feel if somebody killed a family member or a close friend? Would you want them to be punished?"

She committed murder, a thing that can get you in major trouble, even if you're an accompalice. I don't care what the reason was, it could have been accidental, there could have been someone trying to attack her, or whatever, she killed someone.

Even though people make mistakes, a murder is always commited with the best of intentions to kill.

arg33312_arg33261	o8_5,o9_1	As an ambitious, young person wanting to become a lawful, successful, homicide detective, I would not be lenient with any murderer in my midst. <br/> Hopefully, the murder wouldn't be the result of a pleasure/malicious-kill, so that the sentencing won't be as harsh, but nonetheless, all murderers must be tried. After all, hopefully my spouse will understand that having to live in hiding is basically the same as being in prison except much worse since there would be little chance for parole since they will have to live with the guilt and/or the fear of being caught for the rest of their lives.	Well I understand some people are crazy in love, but for me that would be to crazy. Taking another persons life is never the solution or acceptable.

If my spouse committed murder I would have to turn them in, because I don't think I could go on with life knowing that they've murdered someone.

I dont want to be the acomplice and be caught. Plus, if my spouse killed someone, she would be too crazy for me so therefore I would break up with her.

Would you want them to be punished?" So for doing a wrong and to become better you have to take your consequence's.	The murders of a person is a crime that cant be overlook, to sleep next to a person who has commited this crime, and you knowing about makes you as much responsible as that persons.

If my husband killed a random stranger, then YES I would definitely turn him in because that considers him a psycho and what if he kills me too. But if he killed a person that I knew and that was harming us then I would think about it. It's most likely that I would turn him in just because I would be afraid to leave with a person like that, and also what if he thinks I will say something and kills me too.

If you kill someone then i think you should do the right thing and turn yourself in, instead of waiting and wondering if someone else would turn you in.

arg33289_arg33224	o9_3	Yes definately i will turn him in to the police because he has commited a murder and its a sin. Maybe if he gets arrested,he can feel guilty for what he has done and try not to repeat it again. And also how can i trust a murderer?He can even be telling a lie to me and maybe can kill me for someone else in the future.so Just by confiding to me does not make him clean and innocent.	I would say yes to some circumstances I would say yes but for others it would be a no I will not turn them in. I feel that if my spouse killed a person out of self defense or out of defense for another person then no I wouldn't turn them in. Another circumstance would be if they killed a person for killing someone or something like I that, then no I wouldn't turn them in. If they killed cold heartedly like rape, for money, objects and or just a pure disliking or a person then yes I would turn them in because someone that's that cold could kill me.
