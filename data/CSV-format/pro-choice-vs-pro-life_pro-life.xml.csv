So what if we cannot see the human form, it does have the potential to gain one. <br/> Around 60% of abortions are performed on never married women. Why can't women give the baby up for adoption instead, even if she is raped. If your raped does that give you the right to got out and kill someone?	There is only one situation in which I believe abortion is okay. <br/> If a mother is incapable of giving birth to the child, and attempting it might kill her, I believe abortion is sad, but necessary. <br/> Otherwise, no one has the right to kill a child, born or unborn.
13300_13279	o8_1	I'm pro-life based on one major fact.... abortion being used the way it is today.. like a last minute form of birth control. If your too stupid to wear protection, get on the pill, just give the baby up, there are thousands of people who can't have children who'd love to have it.	In Nebraska, it's legal to have an abortion by killing the baby while it's coming out of the womb. How can you argue against that?
59722_13303	o8_1	There should be no argument in this really...whatever way yu see a fetus...its still a living form that has been created in a very intimate way... you shouldn't be changing what mothernature or God or fate or whatever has decided for you...and if you didn;t wannna get preggo in the first place...don't have sex or use protection. <br/> Yeh there are some women that get raped and it's very unfortunate but they should give the child up for adoption. It's not the child's fault that it was created. So why should the goring being have to pay the ultimate price of it's life?	Well "The Champ" It is not the Woman's body we are talking about, it is a new life. And if you are going to be irresponsible dont let a new life die for it!

13275_13268	o8_4	"The government has no place to tell a woman what she can do with her own body, ever." <br/> The government DOES have that right. <br/> 1) a woman cannot legally prostitute herself in many states <br/> 2) a woman cannot take illicit drugs into her own body <br/> 3) a woman cannot use her body to murder others <br/> 4) a woman cannot use her body to steal <br/> 5) a woman cannot display her naked body in public <br/> there are many others.

People have the stupid excuss that it's not a baby, it's a fetus. if you look it up in the dictionary, it says that a fetus is an unborn baby.
13279_13260	o8_1,o6_1	There are tons of ways to not get pregnant. There are condoms (99% effective) for men and women, there are morning-after pills (75% effective), the patch, pill, and other forms of ways not to get pregnant. It's the woman's fault that she didn't do it. <br/> And maybe instead of Pro-choice vs. Pro-life, they (i don't know who "they" is) should have pro-life, but with exceptions (i.e. women that get raped) so that it's fair all-around.

30319_76937	o8_1	Statistics prove that less than 1% of women who are raped get pregnant because of the adrenalin rush. We have no right to take an unborn child's life. There are ways to avoid the situation of abortion. The woman can have the baby and give it up for adoption or raise it as their own because the woman is the still the child's biological mother. There are thousands of people on the waiting list for another baby to add to their family. DO NOT let anyone tell you otherwise because they obviously havn't been in the situation of adoption or abortion.	I choose life.

Actually the government does tell women what they can and can't do with their bodies <br/> It's illegal to commit suicide <br/> If a person is caught trying to hack themselves to peices they could be placed in a mental institute <br/> So the government actually does limit what a woman can do with her body
13279_13276	o7_1	In Nebraska, it's legal to have an abortion by killing the baby while it's coming out of the womb.

Why does the situation change so drastically just because the child is inside the womb?	there isnt an excuse in the world to kill a fetus, a baby, a child, anyone. <br/> if the woman was raped, it most certainly is Not the baby's fault. the woman with the baby whoever they are should speak For the baby, and know that the baby would want to live.

13258_13257	o8_1	Actually the government does tell women what they can and can't do with their bodies <br/> It's illegal to commit suicide <br/> If a person is caught trying to hack themselves to peices they could be placed in a mental institute <br/> So the government actually does limit what a woman can do with her body	That situation is very rare and can usually be countered with a contraceptive drug if the woman seeks medical attention after the assault

Murder....is murder
13280_13270	o9_1,o6_1	"If a women is raped" is a good argument. However why would you punish an innocent baby with the death penalty for some other man's crime. If the women does not want the child she could give it up for adoption. I just dont understand why you would kill the baby, the emotional trauma would happen without the baby as well.	i do not see any difference in killing an embroyo or a 40 year old person. Murder....is murder
54558_80248	o8_1,o6_1	No matter what circumstance a woman is in SHE got herself pregnant! When rape occurs why is it the poor, defenceless baby who gets no choice and dies? The baby is innocent, yes it wasnt the mothers fault but why is she more important than a child? <br/> Women have become selfish where there bodies are concerned. They believe they have the right to get pregnant and then get rid of the baby because they feel like it and made a mistake. These are childrens lives we are talking about	I am Pro-Life, <br/> Here is a question for anyone who is Pro-Choice: Is the baby in the mother's stomach living and if not how do you know?
34485_76937	o8_1	there isnt an excuse in the world to kill a fetus, a baby, a child, anyone. <br/> if the woman was raped, it most certainly is Not the baby's fault. the woman with the baby whoever they are should speak For the baby, and know that the baby would want to live.	I choose life. Keeping the law pro-choice is allowing women to murder their own unborn human child.
13264_13303	o8_5	There should be no argument in this really...whatever way yu see a fetus...its still a living form that has been created in a very intimate way... you shouldn't be changing what mothernature or God or fate or whatever has decided for you...and if you didn;t wannna get preggo in the first place...don't have sex or use protection. <br/> Yeh there are some women that get raped and it's very unfortunate but they should give the child up for adoption. It's not the child's fault that it was created. So why should the goring being have to pay the ultimate price of it's life?	Don't kid yourself: the vast majority of abortions in this country are for reasons of convenience. If I was allowed to kill someone anytime they were inconvenient to me, I would be leaving a trail of bodies behind me when I walked down the street.
76937_13269	o8_1,o7_1	Is personhood absolute or is it predicated upon position? <br/> If a premature baby is lying in an incubator or, let's say for the sake of argument, a 5 gallon pail, it is illegal to kill it. Why does the situation change so drastically just because the child is inside the womb?	I choose life. Keeping the law pro-choice is allowing women to murder their own unborn human child.
13268_13300	o8_1	I'm pro-life based on one major fact.... abortion being used the way it is today.. like a last minute form of birth control. If your too stupid to wear protection, get on the pill, just give the baby up, there are thousands of people who can't have children who'd love to have it.	I argue for the rights of the child, who deserves the same right to life as the mother
30319_54474	o8_1,o5_2	Statistics prove that less than 1% of women who are raped get pregnant because of the adrenalin rush. We have no right to take an unborn child's life. There are ways to avoid the situation of abortion. The woman can have the baby and give it up for adoption or raise it as their own because the woman is the still the child's biological mother. There are thousands of people on the waiting list for another baby to add to their family. DO NOT let anyone tell you otherwise because they obviously havn't been in the situation of adoption or abortion.	A growing embryo is considered human with the heartbeats initiating as early as 21st day of conception. So what if we cannot see the human form, it does have the potential to gain one. <br/> Around 60% of abortions are performed on never married women. Why can't women give the baby up for adoption instead, even if she is raped. If your raped does that give you the right to got out and kill someone?
13259_13279	o8_1,o7_1	Nobody has the right to tell you what to do with your body, but if that which you are trying to rid off moves away at the first sign of pain, without you feeling it, then "that" is no longer yours, since it feels outside your own.	In Nebraska, it's legal to have an abortion by killing the baby while it's coming out of the womb. How can you argue against that?
