School uniform is important <br/> 1.school uniform is a logos for our school <br/> 2.to remind us that we are part of the school <br/> 3.and if we use the uniform basically student used to think what are they gonna do to, is it positive or negative <br/> 4.in the morning we should use our uniform and if were not use our uniform the teacher give us a punishment and from that we can learn to be a discipline student <br/> 5.if we go out from the school than the teacher will see we used the school uniform so people will know that we from that school <br/> thankyou	Uniforms allow an equal and fair social status only based on personality and not looks. I do half to admit wearing what you want is fun and creative but its only fun if everyone can do it and for some children thats not the case and they cant afford to live up to their peers standards so uniforms would make social life much easier and it would give a more mature look to the school.

That's a load of bull. Is school the only place these kids go? What is stopping them from going home and putting on different clothes after school? And it isn't the schools job to make sure that every kid gets to "express their opinion." School is meant to be a learning environment, not a fashion show or a night club.	I think that such a policy is a good idea. Uniforms make students equal on an economic level This can be prevent envy and jealousy.
arg198376_arg203291	o8_1	That's really good idea. As i remember every morning i though what was better to wear? It was really problem, i spent quiet a lot of time. I asked my parents to buy new clothes for me, it was happened not rare. I know that not everyone thought as me, but it much better if the school has own uniform and everybody has to follow it. First it looks very good, smart. Secondly there is no envy that somebody have really nice skirt or jeans. Every pupil is the same and it would be easy to study, to not think about another things!!

arg542561_arg200133	o5_3	THE SCHOOL UNIFORM IS A VERY GOOOOOOOOOD IDEA , WHY ?? <br/> becouse the school uniform makes pupils concentrated on their education than on their clothes and I believe that school uniform instills discipline among pupils it makes pupils with diferent material statuses more equal :)	school uniform does no harm to students life emotions now as for the point of expressing oneself imagine one bully wearing shirt,tie,pant all neatly ironed and well polished shoes wont he look good.remember dressing sense also is a part of ur interveiw
arg198711_arg234631	o9_1,o5_2	I actually believe that uniforms are good and in schools should be school uniforms. In this situation you don't have to constantly worry about what you're gonna wear every morning. And for it time you will be do any important thing which help to you in lessons. Yes, it might be a little boring putting on the same set of clothes but it's less costly this way, and you do not have to go on shopping trips so regularly.	i think it's a good idea. so the student don't have to worry about what would they wear. they'll become more concentrate with their study so it's more efficient. if other says they can't express them self, oh please, there's so many things you can do to express yourself. and i think, uniform indirectly give thought how to dress correctly. if we let them dress theirself, they could wear Inappropriate clothes such as hot pants, rebel jeans or sexy clothes. that's not good for their mind.
