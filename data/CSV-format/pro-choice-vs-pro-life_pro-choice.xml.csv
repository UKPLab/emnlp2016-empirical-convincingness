74766_1633	o9_1	If a woman is raped and left with the bastard child of the man who raped her and severely emotionally traumatized her, she should have the decision to give up that baby.

73708_1658	o6_1,o6_3	I don't think a mother should have the choice to kill her child. But I think she does have the choice of whether a fetus should be considered a human being.

1658_1654	o9_2,o7_1	Yeah, try to enforce that! It is actually not illegal to commit suicide everywhere (ever been to Oregon?). <br/> Being pro-choice and keeping abortion legal leaves the decision with the woman and her God instead of with the government. The government has enough power without forcing the views of one religion on others.	Hitler's mother wanted to have him aborted. Needless to say they should have let her.
1660_1639	o5_3	It's not a question of what YOU choose, it's a question of "who decides"? <br/> A woman is not your property. Nor is she the property of your church, the state, or any fetus. You have no right to command her servitude.	So then you're saying the if the woman were to get an abortion right after than t would be fine?
71522_37929	o8_1,o6_1	Im going to take the Obama approach to this <br/> Abortion is never something a women would take lightly there will always be a lot of thinking asking for help and even praying involved with making that decision. The pro-life people just don't seam to understand that we also think the abortion is a sad and awful thing and we pro-choicers hope nobody would ever have to make this difficult and life altering situation. there for this decision should be left to the women and not some man miles away in d.c. that has never faced it	it's the woman's choice. you cannot control her. (anyway how do u know she just wouldn't kill herself in attempt to kill her baby as well?)

Who are we to judge what is right or wrong? Can we not just let people make decisions and live with the consequences?

The state intervenes in the cases in instances of mental illness. <br/> You will need to find a better answer. Sorry. Try again.
1634_1674	o8_4	It really depends the situation; if a girl/woman gets raped, it's not fair that she has to keep the child. If a young teen has unprotected sex and ends up with a child, that's her fault for not being prepared.	No one ever mentions that the cause of over 99% of all abortions is unwanted pregnancies. If you prevent those, you prevent abortions. Wouldn't that make both sides happy?
1661_69016	o8_4,o6_2	While I personally do not think that abortion is right in any way shape or form. I do not believe the government has the right to make that decision. This is a decision to be made by the parents of the unborn child. NOT the government.	Who are we to judge what is right or wrong? Can we not just let people make decisions and live with the consequences?
1565373184_1641	o5_1	Surely if we are worried about the feelings of unborn children within the first few months of pregnancy, than we should first be worried about protecting the rights of far more conscious animals, such as fully-developed primates. <br/> If its isn't their feelings we are worried about, then I guess I am very confused about the pro-life point of view.	Pro-Life means the problem of overpopulation is being directly supplied, as well as many more crack-addicted/poverty ridden babies are born. Pro-Choice ftw
1565373184_73708	o9_3,o5_2,o6_1,o7_2	I don't think a mother should have the choice to kill her child. But I think she does have the choice of whether a fetus should be considered a human being.

1660_1654	o8_1,o7_1,o7_3	Yeah, try to enforce that! It is actually not illegal to commit suicide everywhere (ever been to Oregon?). <br/> Being pro-choice and keeping abortion legal leaves the decision with the woman and her God instead of with the government.

63512_43517	o9_1,o9_3,o5_2	Here's a story for you from a few years back. A nine year old girl living in poverty in South America was raped by her step dad, and got pregnant with twins. Her family knew that she would die in childbirth, but she was not allowed to get an abortion because they were devout catholics. Both her and her two children died. That's three lives lost. One of those lives actually knew what life was.	Pro-lifers want live babies so they can grow up to be dead soldiers, ironic eh? <br/> Women are people too, and it should be their choice to what they bring into the world.

1636_1662	o8_4	I am personally against the abortion, but I believe in the right of choice. What matters to a pregnant mother what I think or what most of the people thinks about it.

To be human, you must have both the following criteria (IMO) <br/> You must be human (homosapien) <br/> You must be able to contribute to society. <br/> By this criterium, a fetus cannot be considered human, and therefore, abortion is not murder.	Who are we to judge what is right or wrong? Can we not just let people make decisions and live with the consequences?

63512_73708	o8_4	Here's a story for you from a few years back. A nine year old girl living in poverty in South America was raped by her step dad, and got pregnant with twins.

Until you've walked a mile in these girl's/women's shoes, than you may have the opportunity to speak on their behalf. Until then, you may not have to like it and may stand firm with your opinion, but at least have the audacity to respect other's opinions on the subject matter.	In the United States of America, pro-choice is the only constitutional way to go. Elsewhere in the world, people will do whatever they want.
1658_71522	o8_1	it's the woman's choice. you cannot control her. (anyway how do u know she just wouldn't kill herself in attempt to kill her baby as well?)	Hitler's mother wanted to have him aborted. Needless to say they should have let her.
1660_1665	o8_1,o5_1,o7_3	I dont want to say i officially have a position, but i want someone on the other side to answer this because i honestly just dont know: <br/> if a 14 year old is raped (which, we have established, happens), and she then gets pregnant, but because she is 14, she will die if she has the baby, what is the pro life decision? is it then pro-life to have an abortion? <br/> i just dont know and i want an answer from someone on the other side	So then you're saying the if the woman were to get an abortion right after than t would be fine?
43517_1700	o7_3	Pro-lifers want live babies so they can grow up to be dead soldiers, ironic eh? <br/> Women are people too, and it should be their choice to what they bring into the world.

1634_58594	o8_1	It really depends the situation; if a girl/woman gets raped, it's not fair that she has to keep the child. If a young teen has unprotected sex and ends up with a child, that's her fault for not being prepared.	It's not yours, nor anyone else's but the person involved's decision as to whether or not they want an abortion. This is such an overblown issue that people on both sides are being killed over it--it's ridiculous, and this needs to be left alone.
1654_1641	o9_3	Yeah, try to enforce that!

Surely if we are worried about the feelings of unborn children within the first few months of pregnancy, than we should first be worried about protecting the rights of far more conscious animals, such as fully-developed primates. <br/> If its isn't their feelings we are worried about, then I guess I am very confused about the pro-life point of view.

1639_1636	o9_4	I am personally against the abortion, but I believe in the right of choice. What matters to a pregnant mother what I think or what most of the people thinks about it. She must decide what to do with her child.	It's not a question of what YOU choose, it's a question of "who decides"? <br/> A woman is not your property. Nor is she the property of your church, the state, or any fetus. You have no right to command her servitude.
1698_1674	o6_1	No one ever mentions that the cause of over 99% of all abortions is unwanted pregnancies. If you prevent those, you prevent abortions. Wouldn't that make both sides happy?	This is a rather simple choice for me. I choose pro-choice because I have the option to choose pro life. If I choose pro-life I have no choice.
37093_1660	o7_2	Ahora en mi querido idioma, lo diré <br/> Eso a lo que llaman un "bebé, un ser humano" no es más que una planta, menos, me atrevería a decir <br/> Lo único que hace es chupar recursos, al igual que la planta, aunque las plantas nos dan oxígeno... <br/> Nadie niega que sea una vida, pero no puede sentir ni pensar, que es lo que suelen decir que hace más a los humanos que a los animales <br/> El aborto es matar a un parásito	So then you're saying the if the woman were to get an abortion right after than t would be fine?
1565373184_37929	o8_1	Im going to take the Obama approach to this <br/> Abortion is never something a women would take lightly there will always be a lot of thinking asking for help and even praying involved with making that decision. The pro-life people just don't seam to understand that we also think the abortion is a sad and awful thing and we pro-choicers hope nobody would ever have to make this difficult and life altering situation. there for this decision should be left to the women and not some man miles away in d.c. that has never faced it	Pro-Life means the problem of overpopulation is being directly supplied, as well as many more crack-addicted/poverty ridden babies are born. Pro-Choice ftw
28415_1698	o8_4	Giving up a child has to be one of the most responsible decisions a woman can make in her life. Have you any idea the responsibility and maturity it takes to make such an important decision? <br/> If a woman can not support a child(Either emotionally, physically, or financially) she should have right to choose to give up that child.	This is a rather simple choice for me. I choose pro-choice because I have the option to choose pro life. If I choose pro-life I have no choice.
1674_1683	o6_1	No one ever mentions that the cause of over 99% of all abortions is unwanted pregnancies. If you prevent those, you prevent abortions. Wouldn't that make both sides happy?	In the United States of America, pro-choice is the only constitutional way to go. Elsewhere in the world, people will do whatever they want.
1641_74766	o7_3	The right to abortion should not be abused, <br/> however I do believe that the choice should be provided. <br/> NOBODY should make decisions of what an individual should do with her body.	Surely if we are worried about the feelings of unborn children within the first few months of pregnancy, than we should first be worried about protecting the rights of far more conscious animals, such as fully-developed primates. <br/> If its isn't their feelings we are worried about, then I guess I am very confused about the pro-life point of view.

You have no right to command her servitude.	I support pro choice if nothing else because it is one of the last bastions that free people hold out against the government for.
1565373184_74039	o6_3	You don't know these girl's/women's stories, who are you to judge what they can or can't do? Until you've walked a mile in these girl's/women's shoes, than you may have the opportunity to speak on their behalf. Until then, you may not have to like it and may stand firm with your opinion, but at least have the audacity to respect other's opinions on the subject matter.

43517_73708	o5_1	I don't think a mother should have the choice to kill her child. But I think she does have the choice of whether a fetus should be considered a human being. A fetus with a nervous system much less developed than that of a cow should not have greater rights than a cow.	Pro-lifers want live babies so they can grow up to be dead soldiers, ironic eh? <br/> Women are people too, and it should be their choice to what they bring into the world.
46240_28841	o8_1,o6_1	Abortion is ok because a fetus isn't a human. To be human, you must have both the following criteria (IMO) <br/> You must be human (homosapien) <br/> You must be able to contribute to society. <br/> By this criterium, a fetus cannot be considered human, and therefore, abortion is not murder.	a common argument is, "what if the baby was to be the next DaVinci?" <br/> there is a simple counter to this: <br/> what if this person who hets pregnant is to be a legendary figure in the world but never gets to because she has to raise a baby that she was unprepared for.
1654_1635	o6_1	Yeah, try to enforce that! It is actually not illegal to commit suicide everywhere (ever been to Oregon?). <br/> Being pro-choice and keeping abortion legal leaves the decision with the woman and her God instead of with the government. The government has enough power without forcing the views of one religion on others.	I support pro choice if nothing else because it is one of the last bastions that free people hold out against the government for.

I dont want to say i officially have a position, but i want someone on the other side to answer this because i honestly just dont know: <br/> if a 14 year old is raped (which, we have established, happens), and she then gets pregnant, but because she is 14, she will die if she has the baby, what is the pro life decision? is it then pro-life to have an abortion? <br/> i just dont know and i want an answer from someone on the other side

28841_58594	o5_2	It's not yours, nor anyone else's but the person involved's decision as to whether or not they want an abortion. This is such an overblown issue that people on both sides are being killed over it--it's ridiculous, and this needs to be left alone.	a common argument is, "what if the baby was to be the next DaVinci?" <br/> there is a simple counter to this: <br/> what if this person who hets pregnant is to be a legendary figure in the world but never gets to because she has to raise a baby that she was unprepared for.

1637_63512	o8_1,o6_1	Here's a story for you from a few years back. A nine year old girl living in poverty in South America was raped by her step dad, and got pregnant with twins. Her family knew that she would die in childbirth, but she was not allowed to get an abortion because they were devout catholics. Both her and her two children died. That's three lives lost. One of those lives actually knew what life was.	Here's an interesting thought for those of you who believe "life" begins at conception rather than birth... America grants citizenship to people "born" in the United States, but not to those conceived here. <br/> Perhaps if you truly believe life begins at conception and that is a full person with rights to life, then we should also grant citizenship to that person, no?
