I used to think that belief in God was reasonable before the theory of evolution. However, the "who created the creator" argument seems to apply here.

794_74767	o8_1	You can actually see evolution happen. Fruit Flies are quite useful for this experiment since the breed, live, and die so quickly. You have to understand evolution happens because of mutations and they survive because those mutations have made it easier for the creature to survive then the others. ie. natural selection. Speciation is also an example of evolution... different species come about because they have adapted to a slightly different enviroment. If you look you can see evolution	There's no concrete evidence that supports that god exists. <br/> Religion and the bible have too many contradictions and changes that I become less and less convinced in his existence... <br/> Evolution makes more sense to me. <br/> Animals adapt to their environment, and over huge amounts of time will evolve <br/> to be able to survive through different climates and situations.

What's your point?

58082_785	o8_1,o5_2,o6_1	I like to think both are true. <br/> 1. God created the first things (i don't think adam and ever were really human, maybe single celled. but man had a hard time believing that so we made the first creatures Man) <br/> 2. Those things God created Evolved to fit their surroundings. (there is proof of this, you can not deny this. i do not know if we came from monkeys or not.) <br/> I believe in God and Evolution.	There is not God. I just use him in my arguments to make sarcastic comments. Sorry.

And dont say, because we would notice if we were. <br/> Solid varifiable evidence if your key to proving your point.

The universe started out as a hot, dense space. Scientists know that because now nearby galaxies are moving further and further away and the universe is expanding and becoming cooler, so, in the past, the universe must have been hotter and more dense. Earth was the perfect candidate for life because it has the "Goldilocks" conditions. Bacteria started to form from molecules, which formed into fish, and then amphibians, then land animals, then monkeys, then humans.	Why not both? Why can't God have created a way for evolution to happen. <br/> Who says that God did it himself? <br/> Who says that God didn't cause the Big Bang or evolution to occur? <br/> FINAL ANSWER: EVOLUTION THROUGH CREATION

I used to think that belief in God was reasonable before the theory of evolution. However, the "who created the creator" argument seems to apply here. An all-knowing all-powerful loving, merciful, personal God is as complex a creature as I can imagine, so complex life cannot be explained by a complex creator.

806_803	o5_1	I have to contradict phro and say that the peppered moths do show evidence of evolution. The data may have been insufficient, but evolution did occur. <br/> When different alleles are expressed due to external factors, this is evolution.	sabrejimmy, <br/> I have not tried to prove ANYTHING. All i asked was for YOU to prove that we are not evolving. <br/> Not once did i say that we are still evolving. <br/> I have not made any such assertions. <br/> So until you can show that we are not evolving with credible evidence, you are just avoiding something you cannot answer. <br/> So i say again, back up YOUR claim that we are not evolving. <br/> And the big bang is a red herring, we are talking about evolution, NOT Cosmology. <br/> It looks like you are trying to steer the debate away from what it is because you cannot back up your claims.

What's your point?
814_72483	o8_1	Evolution is a science. All the refutes I have seen (which I will rebuttal after this) have nothing to do with science. Their claims are theological claims.

74907_817	o8_1	Radiometric dating can be done in many ways. Today there are over 40 different techniques to do it. It is the fact they are independent, observable, and falsifiable that makes it scientific rigor. I would recommend going tohttp://www.asa3.org/aSA/resources/Wiens.html for more information on radiometric dating.	I used to think that belief in God was reasonable before the theory of evolution. However, the "who created the creator" argument seems to apply here. An all-knowing all-powerful loving, merciful, personal God is as complex a creature as I can imagine, so complex life cannot be explained by a complex creator.

You lost me--- 99% of what you say speaks IN FAVOR of evolution and AGAINST creationism <br/> --- At most you point out that science doesn't have all the answers (no scientist would try to counter you on that one) and that there may easily be halfway point between faith/science where evolution and creationism can co-exist (a great many liberal theologians and even agnostics would have no real problem with that idea)

58082_794	o8_1,o7_1	You can actually see evolution happen. Fruit Flies are quite useful for this experiment since the breed, live, and die so quickly. You have to understand evolution happens because of mutations and they survive because those mutations have made it easier for the creature to survive then the others. ie. natural selection. Speciation is also an example of evolution... different species come about because they have adapted to a slightly different enviroment. If you look you can see evolution	I like to think both are true. <br/> 1. God created the first things (i don't think adam and ever were really human, maybe single celled. but man had a hard time believing that so we made the first creatures Man) <br/> 2.

Evolution is a science. All the refutes I have seen (which I will rebuttal after this) have nothing to do with science. Their claims are theological claims. Lets first know what science is. Science is known through the scientific method. The scientific method deals only with the natural world. Creationism tries to sneak the supernatural as a scientific explanation.

58082_80854	o8_5,o7_4	Science can prove that evolution is the beginning of life. <br/> The big bang theory is a term used to describe the bursting of molecules that begun the creation of the universe. The universe started out as a hot, dense space. Scientists know that because now nearby galaxies are moving further and further away and the universe is expanding and becoming cooler, so, in the past, the universe must have been hotter and more dense. Earth was the perfect candidate for life because it has the "Goldilocks" conditions. Bacteria started to form from molecules, which formed into fish, and then amphibians, then land animals, then monkeys, then humans.	I like to think both are true. <br/> 1. God created the first things (i don't think adam and ever were really human, maybe single celled. but man had a hard time believing that so we made the first creatures Man) <br/> 2.
