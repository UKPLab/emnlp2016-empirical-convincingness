Porn is not wrong. If it is really wrong, then Porn should be "Illegal". Porn supplies the "Erotic" needs of people who doesn't have a partner. :)

Porn hardly ever leads to addiction, just in weak people, maybe who have mental health issues, or attachment issues or find it hard to separate fantasy from reality. I watch porn once or twice a day when i'm on my own but also have a great boyfriend and we have sex once or twice (sometimes three, if i'm lucky!) times a week, we use porn to spice things up in the bedroom but we know it's all fantasy, we're not idiots, we just have desires that need to be met!	I don't feel degraded by porn. You don't like it? Don't watch it. There are more importhant jobs in life than to be my personal morality police.
